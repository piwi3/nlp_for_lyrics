Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Free
