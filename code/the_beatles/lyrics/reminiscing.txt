I'm just sittin' here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissin'
Baby, wo oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
Well, you know my heart's still sore

When I think of all the lies you told
To that junk man my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kinda makes me feel so sad
I'm lonely, for your love
And the longest day I live
It's only you that I'll be thinking of
You know I'm thinkin' of
Well, it's you I'm thinking of, mmm mmm
