Woman, I can hardly express 
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman, I will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Ooh, well, doo doo doo doo doo.
Ooh, well, well, doo doo doo doo doo

Woman, I know you understand the little child inside a man
Please remember, my life is in your hands, and woman
Hold me close to your heart, however distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars

Ooh, well 

Woman, please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again 
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever
