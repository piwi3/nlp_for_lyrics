She looks as an African queen, 
She eating twelve chapattis and cream,
She tastes as Mongolian lamb, 
She coming from out of Bahran. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
She like to be married with Yeti, 
He grooving such cooky spaghetti, 
She jumping as Mexican bean 
To make that her body more thin.
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
She catch Patagonian pancake 
With that one a gin party makes. 
She having all the ways good contacts, 
She making with Apple an contract. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 

All together now: 
What a shame Mary Jane
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane

She tastes as Mongolian lamb.
