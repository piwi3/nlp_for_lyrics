Wait, oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, Mister Postman

Mister Postman, look and see
(Oh yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please, please, Mister Postman) I been waiting a long, long time
(Whoah, yeah) Since I heard from that girl of mine

There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me

(Please, Mister Postman) Mister Postman look and see
(Oh, yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please, please, Mister Postman) I been waiting a long, long time
(Oh, yeah) Since I heard from that girl of mine

So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

Mister Postman, look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
I been waiting a long, long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta check it and see, one more time for me
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
