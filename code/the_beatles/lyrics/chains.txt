Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
And they ain't the kind that you can see.
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me. Yeah!
 
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains,
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free.
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be. Yeah!
 
Now believe me when I tell you I think you're fine.
I'd like to hold you, but, darling, I'm imprisoned by these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
And they ain't the kind that you can see.
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, Yeah!
 
I wanna tell you pretty baby, your lips look sweet.
I'd like to kiss them, But I can't break away from all these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
And they ain't the kind that you can see.
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, Yeah!
