Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
