Well you call me your baby
When you're holdin' my hand
Mm, how you can hurt me
I just don't understand

Well you say that you need me
Like the ocean needs sand
But the way you mistreat me
I just don't understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand (don't understand)

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand (don't understand)

Well you call me your baby
And you hold my hand
Ah, honey, you hurt me
And I just don't understand (don't understand)
