This is the story of a boy named Teddy
If his mother said "Teddy be good"
He would (alright)
She told him, Teddy, about his soldier daddy
But it made herself, and she cried, oh My!
Teddy used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
'Cause in his head
He said
"Mommy, don't worry, now Teddy Boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy, don't worry, good Teddy Boy's here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
And she said:
"Teddy, don't worry, your mommy is here
Taking good care of you"
She said
"Teddy don't worry, mommy is here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
He said: do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Then came a day she found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran, oh, far away, OK.
He couldn't stand just to be around
So he left the town far away, yeh yeh
Day after day he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head
He said:
"Mommy, don't worry, now Teddy Boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy, don't worry, your Teddy Boy's here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
And she said:
"Teddy, don't worry, now mommy's here
Taking good care of you
Teddy, don't worry, now your mommy is here
Mommy's gonna see you through"
And he said:
"Mommy, don't worry, your Teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, Teddy boy's here
Teddy's gonna see you through"
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Oh yeah
