Sherry baby (Sherry baby, Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight? (come come, come out tonight)
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight?

(Why don't you come out?) (come out) to my twist party
(Come out) where the bright moon shines
(Come out) we'll dance the night away
I'm gonna make you mine

Sherry baby (Sherry baby, Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight?
(Come come, come out tonight)
(Come come, come out tonight)

You better ask your mama (Sherry baby)
Tell her everything is all right

(Why don't you come out?) (come out) with your red dress on
(Come out) Hmm, you look so fine
(Come out) Move it nice and easy
Girl, you'll make me lose my mind

Sherry baby (Sherry baby, Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight?
(Come come, come out tonight)
(Come come, come out tonight)
