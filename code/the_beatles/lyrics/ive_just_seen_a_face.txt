I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

(Yeah)
(Bup-a-lup-bup)

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

Oh, fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
