Hey! We are following the footsteps of those who've gone before and we'll all be reunited on that new and sunlit shore.

[Chorus:]
Oh, when the saints go marching in, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in.

And when the sun refuse to shine, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the sun refuse to shine.

Oh, when the trumpet sound its call, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the trumpet sounds that call.

Oh, when the new world is revealed, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the new world is revealed.

[Chorus]
