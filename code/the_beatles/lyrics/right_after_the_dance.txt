Well I would if I could and if I got the chance make love to you right after the dance
We'll park by the river underneath the moon on my old guitar I'll play you a tune
Well things will be right and the moon will be bright
And maybe you'll let me hold you tight
Stick around baby and give me the chance to make love to you right after the dance

Well we won't quarrel and we won't fight and maybe we'll stay out all the night
I'll hug and kiss you if you'll give me the chance
To make love to you right after the dance 
We'll bill and coo and patch a little woo and maybe you'll say oh yes I do
Well I'll be the teacher if you'll take a chance
And we'll have call for preacher right after the dance

We'll bill and coo...
