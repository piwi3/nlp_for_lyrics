Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
With the look of fear in my mothers eyes (go, go, go, go, go)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go (go, go, go)

Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said I'm sorry Mark, but there's no where to stay
Turn your back on hope and went back inside
In a broken heart and let the engine die (go, go, go, go, go)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go (go, go, go)

Why do evil men get away with it
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit
Give up all your hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
