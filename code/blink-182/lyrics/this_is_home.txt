We work and slave the day away
We're wasting perfect families
We fucking fight like vagabonds
We dance like fucking animals

Don't stop the band is coming on
Rude boys and punks will shout a lot
Police cars bring cuffs and loaded guns
Kids scream but laughing as they run

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home

Gunshots the punks are rioting
The stage is slowly crumbling
Smash doors and try to stay alive
A few drinks and you look of broken light

They'll hide and call the cavalry
Let's dance in perfect harmony
Get close the crowd will come apart
That girl will try to make you hard

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o do you wanna
This time I-I-I, I-I-I, I hope you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o, do you wanna
This time I-I-I, I-I-I, I hope you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home
