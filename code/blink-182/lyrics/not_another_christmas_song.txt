I hate to be a downer
But I spent too many hours
Crossing days off the calendar
It don't mean nothing to me

I'm burned out like lights on a tree
Old songs, can't listen to these
Fake a smile, but all I can see
Is empty boxes and trees

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas

Why can't we get divorced for Christmas?
'Cause it just isn't the same
(It just isn't the same)
I miss the nights that we got twisted
I miss fucking in the rain
(I miss fucking in the rain)

And now (now) you're always angry
And I'm always saying, "I'm sorry"
Depression's such a lonely business
Why can't we get divorced for Christmas?

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas song

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song
