This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This make no,

This air is too thick to breath so just drive,
these eyes are too sick too see, go leave me behind
something swimming in my blood, somethings rotting in my brain
I'm smothered from the flood, I can't recognize you face,
I need to leave so just drive,

Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last time
I'm always fighting the gravity

Tonight is too much fro me to get through,
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room,
When I'm far away from you.

Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last time
I'm always fighting the gravity
I'm always fighting the gravity

This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This makes no sense
