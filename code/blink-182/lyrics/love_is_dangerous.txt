I've had it with this damn double vision
My hand's swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it, I can't, can't brush it off

Love, love is dangerous
Love, love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, just like my television
It's still sharp and her words cut through the clouds

Love, love is dangerous (just don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one's we've ever care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to f*ck)
Love, love is dangerous

(I need)
Love, love is dangerous (just don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one's we've ever care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to f*ck)
Love, love is dangerous
