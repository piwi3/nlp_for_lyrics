I can almost see your house from here
But the signal seems to disappear so what's the problem?
Houston's calling
Then you hit me like a Friday night
Like a handgun in a firefight
Dive in slow motion towards the ocean

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm kind of nervous of the consequence
As we climb over the neighbor's fence the longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea
Like I'm the only one you'll ever need
We're left abandoned in the deep end

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

(We're teenage satellites)

We are a slow descent
Forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche
We're just an afterthought

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (we're teenage satellites)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (teenage satellites)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (teenage satellites)
