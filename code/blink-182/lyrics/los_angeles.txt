Day in day out
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Whoa
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth

In Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home 
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming)

Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home

Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends

Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
