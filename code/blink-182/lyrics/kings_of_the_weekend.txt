Can you read my thoughts? I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and long night coming

Did you steal my prayers? I don't know where I was
I feel numb and all or nothing
(All or nothing)

It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights, always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

'Til Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something 
To keep going

So just take my hand 
Only seconds left
The clock's running 
Our time's coming

Ah

It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights, always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

'Til Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights, always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

'Til Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend
