My mom, she's not a woman anymore,
She dresses like a man
Dresses like a man,
She's not as feminine as she
Used to be before
Now she is so damned masculine

I close my eyes
My mom's not a woman anymore
She's wearing a disguise
Everytime she leaves through that door

My mom's not the same
As she was in the past
If I misbehave she kicks my ass
My mom's not quite the
Woman that she was before
When my friends come over
She likes to wrestle them down to the floor

And I close my eyes
My mom's not a woman anymore
She's wearing a desguise
Everytime she leaves through that door

My mom's a transvestite
