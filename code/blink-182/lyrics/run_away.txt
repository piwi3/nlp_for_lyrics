Leave me in the sun, I'm melting like a popsicle
Give me the flu, I'm dying in this hospital
I need you close, but you got me backed against a wall
I try to speak, but my mouth doesn't move at all

Sing me right back to sleep
We'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again

Run away, don't let me run away, no
Get away, don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
You wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops, and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out of my head

Lay you in the dark, where we stumble in the mysteries
An opened book that you took, and now I'm history
You moved away, and you left me with your dying wish
I couldn't prove it was you, you're the arsonist

Sing me right back to sleep
We'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again

Run away, don't let me run away, no
Get away, don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
You wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out of my head

(Run away, don't let me run away, no)
(Get away, don't let me get away, no)
(Run away, don't let me run away, no)
(Get away, don't let me get away, no)

Run away, don't let me run away, no
Get away, don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
You wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out of my head

(Run away, don't let me run away, no)
(Get away, don't let me get away, no)
