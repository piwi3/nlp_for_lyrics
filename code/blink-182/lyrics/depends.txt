I don't want to urinate
On myself
I don't want to urinate
On anyone else
Well, I guess that really
Doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control
My bladder anymore
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)

Step back into life
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load
In my underwear

I'm sick of offending
Everyone I meet
(Go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to
Sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat,
I didn't know what to say

But, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)

Step back into life
(Go, go)
No more soiled nights alone
Well, I guess that
I don't have a care
Because there's not
A load in my underwear
