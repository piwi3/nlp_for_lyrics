I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
A I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

You have your other friends
They were there
When you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't
Leave your side

But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
As I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over
(Ah)
