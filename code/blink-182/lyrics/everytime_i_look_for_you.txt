Never found out why you left him
But this answer begs a question
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken
One more point of contention
I need some intervention
Approaching failing tensions
Betray my short attention span
The distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness, round the corner

Every time I look for you
The sun goes down
And I stumble when this
Whole thing runs aground
I left another message
You are never around
But every time I look for you
The sun goes down once more
Will the last one out
Please shut the door

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue
Is this to much to live through
It always seems to far to drive
The point home, send more letters
Pray tomorrow, ends up better

Every time I look for you
The sun goes down
And I stumble when this
Whole thing runs aground
I left another message
You are never around
But every time I look for you
The sun goes down once more
Will the last one out
Please shut the door

I never did do anything
That she asked
I never let what happened
Stay in the past
I never did quite understand
What she meant
In spite of everything
In spite of everything

Every time I look for you
The sun goes down
And I stumble when this
Whole thing runs aground
I left another message
You are never around
But every time I look for you
The sun goes down
And I stumble when this
Whole thing runs aground
I left another message
You are never around
But every time I look for you
The sun goes down
