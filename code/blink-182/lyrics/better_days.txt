Late one day as you're sitting awake
How can you sleep with those pills you take?
Rubs your eyes and miss your head
All you have is meat and you're a vegetarian
Put in your key and your car won't start
Your wife just left you and she took the sports car
All alone and it's one of those days
Oh my god you found out your neighbor's gay

Better days that you had
And you blame it on fate
You've got a bitter feeling in the back of your head
And concentration's asleep
How do you do the things you do
And go on living your life?
You beat your kids all the time
And you constantly yell at your wife

You're at work and you lost your check
And the only secretary has lost her head
More ideas wasted over the months
Now a fire's consumed your home
It's all right, you've got your pride
But if I were you I would rather die
It's all right, you've got your work
But if I were you I'd start going to church

Better days that you had
And you blame it on fate
You've got a bitter feeling in the back of your head
And concentration's asleep
How do you do the things you do
And go on living your life?
You beat your kids all the time
And you constantly yell at your wife
