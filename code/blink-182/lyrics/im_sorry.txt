Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again

Just yesterday it always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructible, nothing happens to our machine
And there's no harm at least nothing we can see
As for you not so true you couldn't choose where his road would lead

What a loss you just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought that this could never happen you see
That it's so hard you gotta get up on your feet
Cause the only way I gotta say is to move on through the week

Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again

I'm sorry (What's happened to you?)

Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again
