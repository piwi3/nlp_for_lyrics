I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for

She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream 
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
And threw herself on the floor

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
