Stop banging away on my kaleidoscope
Stop draining the color out of my scene
Just play me something I can dance to
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

So lock me up in a studio,
Fill it up with sound and scenarios
Stop blocking the driveway with your car
Put the butterfly in the bill jar

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road

Your dangers forcing the front yard
Many hours tick past the deadline
Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine

To leave the progress on your game
Try to fall asleep while your ears ring
From the loudest songs on your mix tape
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

No reason, no action,
No silence, no help here,
Nobody came running up by my side

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road to get it right

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's a long road

To get it right
To get to get to get it right
To get to get it right
To get it right
