What were doing here, now no one knows
The thoughts, the thing that's I don't know
Maybe this is all a nightmare
Your laughter ends in darkness
You can do what you want to
I need some time alone
Between what answers
I need some time alone
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me

Maybe this is just a nightmare
Your laughter end in darkness
Not in the mood, not just to justify
Not in the mood to think of what a lie
You can do what you want to
I need some time alone
Between what answers
I need some time alone
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
