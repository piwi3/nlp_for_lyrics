Eyes are, open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
