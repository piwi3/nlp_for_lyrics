A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember your voice but it's only an echo (only an echo)
I still got your makeup here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts outside of my window

It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times, a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time
Yeah, you used to be all mine, all mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you

I was so wasted I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no I'd never leave you (would never leave you)
Nights that we stayed up days that we sleep through
I can still see your face outside of my window

It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times, a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time
Yeah, you used to be all mine, all mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you

It feels like last night (last night)
You came over (you came over)
Now I wake up (now I wake up)
