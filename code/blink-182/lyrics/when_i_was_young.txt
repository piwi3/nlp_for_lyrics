I woke up today
Surrounded by blackness
A small warning sign
Devoured the process
It’s always been fine
I get up and ignore this
And it’s hard to say
But I feel all of this weightless
But the more that I admit
I feel up and anxious
And the more I go on
The less I can face this
And those rotten things
That live in our shadow
We walk on the line
Of death and the gallows
And hope that we’re clear
I bet we can follow

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

When I was young
The world it was smaller
The cities were vast
The buildings were taller
I felt really strong
My parents seem stronger
My life has a way
Showers with greatness
Then takes it away
Those pieces that made us
The dangerous things
You’d never imagine
We all get the same
The memories that burn
And those pictures we made
They still form a pattern
They courteously say
Does it not matter?

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright
