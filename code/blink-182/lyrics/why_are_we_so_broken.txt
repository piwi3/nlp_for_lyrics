I had a feeling you were trouble
The night I pulled you from the rubble
When will we release this disaster piece?
From the ceiling or the gutter
Get my bleeding heart aflutter
And I can't erase the sad memories

Got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down
Got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

Tonight, why you so broken?
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know all about you
Tonight, why we still holding on?

It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you

Heard a rumor you were leaving
The West Coast tomorrow evening
Wasting no time, saying your goodbyes
For the life of me, I can't find
Anyone to share or kill time
I want you back, my little heart attack

I got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

Tonight, why you so broken?
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know all about you
Tonight, why we still holding on?

When the worlds fall down
And you run from the dust as it covers your lungs
It's never enough for you
When the starlit sky
Comes crashing down up on this waste of a life
It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you

(It's never enough for)
(It's never enough for you)
(It's never enough for)
(It's never enough for you)

I've got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I've got time on my hands
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

It's never enough for you

I've got time on my hands (my hands)
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I got time on my hands (on my hands)
I've got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down
