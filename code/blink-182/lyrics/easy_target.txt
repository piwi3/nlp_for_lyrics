All her signals are getting lost in the ether (that's what she wanted)
She's a landslide with a city beneath her (that's what she wanted)
So take a good look so you'll never forget it (that's what she wanted)
Take a deep breath I know I'm gonna regret it (that's what she wanted)

Holly's looking dry looking for an easy target, 
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it, 
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger, 
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster

She's got a mission and I'm collateral damage (that's what she wanted)
She's the flower that you place on my casket (thats what she wanted)
Savor the moment cause the memory's fleeting
Take a photograph as the last train is leaving

Holly's looking dry looking for an easy target, 
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it, 
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger, 
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster

Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let ne out)
Better run run run run (Holly let me out)
