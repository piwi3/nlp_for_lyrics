When the clock strikes two,
There's just so much to do
And I can't explain what I need
Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping our reputations clean
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Again
The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
Not that I'm poor, just to fine
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
