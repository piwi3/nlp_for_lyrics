Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance
We've been misled
Young and hostile
But not stupid
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Mobs that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules they're f***ed and boring

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame

Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame
