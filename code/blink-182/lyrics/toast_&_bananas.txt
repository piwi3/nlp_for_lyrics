Do you want to know
What I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way
I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time
To fix your head
And now all alone,
One's less than two
I've never been
Better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less
Of what you say

What did you think of me
Acting this way
I guess you never
Really thought at all
Is that what you
Call your brain?
Is that why when I call
You hang up on me?

[Chorus:]
I wanted to know,
I didn't want to lose
And now I'm a man
Who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less
Of what you say

To me as I walk alone I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
To be just another
One, you are lame too

[Chorus]

To me as I tune you
Out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as
I walk alone, I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
Be just another one
You are lame too

Don't talk to me as
I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me
As I walk alone, I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
To be just another one
You are lame too
