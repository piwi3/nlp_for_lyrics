There she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes
And a heart of steel always on her own
Almost never real
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love
And she was like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road clears day of life
Always sharp and cold always beautiful
I am such a fool

When the night will begin
The pain won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love

Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
Driving you mad even if she falls in love
