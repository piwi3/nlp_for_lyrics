I whistle good, I'm kinda straight
And I can, I can, I can have fun
No matter what I do I've always assumed that
I can't go on sucking my thumb

Sifting through the toys waiting at my door
After thinking that I couldn't read
Sitting on my couch and waiting for the porno
While I'm sucking on my damn fugi

I don't know why, I just wanna die
And here's two bucks for you
Guess this is the part where I should really part
But I guess I got nothing to do

I don't know why, I just wanna die
And here's two bucks for you
Guess this is the part where I should really part
But I guess I got nothing to do

What's our grandma think of me?
All that I've got to do today
I guess I should, it's a wonder, I'd say
My breath is how the streets cave in everyday

Oh, how the antelopes
Tom's thumb just walked right through my nose
That's my mom
Into my room until my papa's long gone

What's our grandma think of me?
All that I've got to do today
I guess I should, it's a wonder, I'd say
My breath is how the streets cave in everyday

Guess I should, it's a wonder for God's sake
My breath is how the streets cave in everyday
