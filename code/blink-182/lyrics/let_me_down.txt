Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
You better come around

You save yourself
I'll save myself this time around
You save yourself
I'll save you too next time around
I'm not around
I haven't been here for a while
You know I'll never be back now

Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
You better come around

I won't come around

You take me back to much better days
But those better days weren't good enough
You lit a fire that burned me down
Now down and out's where I'm ending up
You take me back to much better days
But those better days weren't good enough
You lit a fire that burned me down
Now down and out's where I'm ending up

Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
You better come around

I won't come around

She said I'm a letdown
Headed for a meltdown
Loaded but I ain't rich (gaudy but I'm tight-lipped)
Psycho with a death wish (over and over again)
I couldn't change if I wanted to (wanted to)
I couldn't save you when I needed to
On my phone here we go

Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
You better come around

I won't come around
