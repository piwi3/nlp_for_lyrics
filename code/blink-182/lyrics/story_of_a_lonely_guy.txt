Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine I fell behind

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve,
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book, with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy

Who fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm still
Just a stupid, worthless boy
