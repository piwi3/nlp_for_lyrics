I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel

Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
(I had sex with your mother) night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
Night alone

Thanks a lot you guys!
Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to
The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see
You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth
I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck
And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that
Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later!

Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony
Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from
All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah?
