Oh, how I wish that
They would last
Moments of peace that
Just slip through me so fast
Just when I think that
They are gonna stay
Everything inside me
Just starts fading away
Sometimes it seems
Like all I hope for
Just gets thrown
Down on the floor
And then it seems like
You don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that
I could run away
Sometimes I wish
I just had something to say

She looks at me and doesn't
Know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't
Feel quite right today
All these things I say and
Do were never planned
But how the f*ck am I supposed
To make you understand that

Sometimes it seems
Like all I hope for
Just gets thrown
Down on the floor
And then it seems like
You don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that
I could run away
Sometimes I wish
I just had something to say
