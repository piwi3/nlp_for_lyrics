Welcome home
How's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name?
I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?

Okay, enough
P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you
To eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will

And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)

But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)

What the hell?
I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the f*ck is Drew from home, anyway?
This vacation
You said going home was boring
Left out that part of the story on your way

I might deserve it
But I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest
My record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone

And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this

But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)

But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
