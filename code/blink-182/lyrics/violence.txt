Six bottles went down the drain
One hours waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time walk right on by?

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever, and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep
(Fall asleep)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And after, and after, and after)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me,
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
