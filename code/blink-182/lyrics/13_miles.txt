13 miles down the road lives a young boy
He 's got jet black hair and blue-green eyes
And he's mine
And every day now and then,he and I
Would sit together on the porch
And I take off his pants
And I f*ck him from behind

And I love him for his mind and soul
And I love his wrinked scrotum too
So if you see us passing by
On some dreary rainy day
Take a look at the young boy
And his naked asshole
