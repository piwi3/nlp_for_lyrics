I guess I'm blessed to be so fucking bored, and hiding from this
Phantom antigen that wants to send us to the morgue

Quarantine, f*ck this disease
I'd rather be on Star Tours or stuck at the DMV
Quarantine, nah, not for me
I thought that things were fucked up in 2019, f*ck quarantine

Some people hit the bottle
Some people hit the books
Some people storm the Capitol
Some second-guess parenthood

It'll disappear in April, just like a miracle
We don't need social distance, we don't need old people
So throw the shop doors open, save our economy
We don't need ICU beds, or PPE

Quarantine, f*ck this disease
I'd rather watch some magic or do press in Germany
Quarantine, no, not for me
I thought that things were fucked up in 2019, f*ck quarantine

It'll disappear in April, just like a miracle
We don't need social distance, we don't need old people
So throw the shop doors open, save our economy
We don't need ICU beds, we don't need PPE

Quarantine, f*ck this disease
I'm never shaking hands again and don't kiss me on the cheek
F*ck quarantine
