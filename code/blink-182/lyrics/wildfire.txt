I could never own up, I need to speak up
I don't want to grow up, don't want to end up
Caught in a landslide with the other side
Living for the paycheck, dying for the weekend
Take another Xanax, cheating on your girlfriend
Taking your last breath, counting down the time

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

They said I'd never make it (Watching me fall)
All the time I wasted (Learning to crawl)
Crawl from the ashes as this world comes crashing down

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all (The underdogs came home)
We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all

I don't forget, I don't forgive
I'll never change the way I live
I always fought the urge to fall in line
I turned my back on all the rules
I'll never heed the king of fools
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life
