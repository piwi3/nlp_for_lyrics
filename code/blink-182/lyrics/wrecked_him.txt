I thought those words you bring,
Why do you say what you don't mean
To those people who don't care about
What things you might mean
And you just don't know but your
Actions are what shine the most
To those people who don't care if
You end up alone

You need some time to so
All those bridges that you burn
Coz' there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

Have you made up your mind,
How do you know what to decide to those
People who just think that you're just telling lies,
So I give up
I made it clear as it can be to those people
Who don't care about the things that you might mean

You need some time to so
All those bridges that you burn
Coz' there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

You need some time to so
All those bridges that you burn
Coz' there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn
