Never found out why you left him,
but this answer begs that question,
Too blind to see tomorrow,
too broke to beg or borrow.
Young and Stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken

One more point of contention, 
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
betray my short attention span
The distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness, round the corner

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you,
a few more months to argue
Is this to much to live through,
it always seems to far to drive
The point home, send more letters
Pray tomorrow, ends up better

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

I never did do anything that she asked, 
I never let what happened, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant,
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
but everytime I look for you the sun goes down
