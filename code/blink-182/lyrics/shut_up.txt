Shut the f*ck up she said
I'm going fucking deaf
You're always too loud
Everything's too loud

Now that all my friends left
This place is fucking dead
I want to move out
When can we move out
This shit has got to stop
I'll run away

Get the f*ck up she said
Your life is meaningless
It's going nowhere
You're going nowhere

You're just a f*ck up she said
I'll live alone instead
She said "you don't care"
I know I don't care

I'll never ask permission from you
F*ck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home

I got too fucked up again
And passed out on the plane
Tried to forget you
I can't forget you

No sleep on this flight
I'll think about the nights
We had to get through
How did we get through?

I'll never ask permission from you
F*ck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home
I'll run away

I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave

I'll never ask permission from you
F*ck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home
I'll run away

I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
