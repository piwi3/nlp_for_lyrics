Back in that ass

Your mom says hi, jinx!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

Y-y-yeah, y-y-yeah
Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Jam!

Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex

You know, I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the Payless
(Shoe Source)

I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots

Well, it's time to mack
Let's handle that
In 2 to 6 hours
We'll meet back and regroup

So let's shoop!

Roll up to the crib
With some Bartles and James

Hop off the bus
With the Aliz√©

Now hold up, playa
What you diggity-doin here?

I should diggity-ask you the same! (Then she says)

Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together

But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-hah-hah

It's okay
When it's in a 3-way
It's not gay
When it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle
There's some leeway
The area's grey
In a 1-2-3-way

Normally, I don't get down with dudes

But tonight is a special exception (Great)

See, you're my best friend
Through thick and thin

Now it's time to make a triple connection (Lights off)

Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Hoo-Wee!)
This rule dates back (The golden rule)
To ancient Greece (Talkin' bout Caesar)
We're 2 Jack Trippers and a Chrissy

The new Three's Company!

It's okay
When it's in a 3-way
It's not gay
When it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle
There's some leeway
The area's grey
In a 1-2-3-way

Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick
Helicopter dick, Go!
Helicopter dick (Uh!)
Helicopter dick (Alright!)
To impress a chick
Do the Helicopter dick! (Wow)

And all of that was okay
Cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear
When you see the instant replay
"Baby,two is enough"
That's what they'll say
But we'll say "Hell no"
1-2-3 way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The Golden Rule
