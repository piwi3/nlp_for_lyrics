'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek then open up the curtains

'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow

I wanna know, what do you like?
What would you say, if I said I'd do anything to you you want?
I wanna know, yeah, it's alright
New positions, bet you would like
You'll be screaming, "Stop, yes, please, hon"
Baby, you've got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you've ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna wear, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you're a freak

Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?

Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow

Baby, it's a freakshow

When you're alone, what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what I mean
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all, I got a spell
Put it on you and I won't tell
Your secret, 'cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won't behave

Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow
