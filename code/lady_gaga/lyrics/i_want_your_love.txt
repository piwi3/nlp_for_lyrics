I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

Do you feel, like you ever want to try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Oh, all alone, in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you
And I dream of you, all of the time
What am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)

Sometimes, don't you feel like you never really had a love that's real?
Well, here I am and who's to say
A better love you won't find today
Gimme just one chance and I will show you love like no other (like no other)
Two steps above (like no other)
I'm your ladder, I'll be your path
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg
(Please don't make me beg)

I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)

I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds needs sky above
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love

(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(You know I want your love, you know I need your love)

You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
