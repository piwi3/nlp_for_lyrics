What if I were to leave you, 
But then you fell back in love with me?

How could you ever let me go
How could you ever, ever let me go 
I scream your name across the bar 
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar 
Though I just can't seem to forget you
Not ever, just as long as I left you 
You're my baby, you 
Never made it through to you 

If I were the last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earth quake 
Maybe then you'd love 
Maybe then you'd love me 
If there was an earthquake, last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me 
If there was an earthquake 

How could you ever let me go 
How could you ever, ever let me go 
I scream your name across the bar 
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar 
Though I just can't seem to forget you 
Not ever, just as long as I left you 
You're my baby, you 
Never made it through to you 

If I were the last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earth quake 
Maybe then you'd love 
Maybe then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake, last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me 
If there was an earthquake 

If I were the last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me 
If there was an earthquake, last girl 
And you were the last boy 
Left here on this planet 
And there was an earthquake 
Maybe then you'd love
Maybe then you'd love me
