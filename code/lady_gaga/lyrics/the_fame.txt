I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical

All we care about is runway models
Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be
Retro glamor Hollywood, yes, we live for the

Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

I can see myself in the movies
With my picture in the city lights
Photograph, oh my mind and whatever else
You'd like to shoot you decide

All we care about is pornographic girls
On film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see
Television and hot blonds in odd positions

Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time

Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame, doin' it for the fame
Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune
Fame
