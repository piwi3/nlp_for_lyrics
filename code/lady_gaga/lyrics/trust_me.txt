"Thank you very much
Have a good night
There is a friend of mine who, uh, came a long way to be here
And she wrote a great song, and I'd just like her to sing it
I think it's pretty fucking good"

"How are you? You made it!"
"I'm good, hi, how are you?"
"It's so good to see you"
"It was so good"
"Everything alright? The trip was fine?"
"Yeah!"
"I did an arrangement, it was kinda not-so-great, but uh"
"No, I can't do that, I'm sorry"
"Maybe you could just stick with- yeah you're good"
"Here we go"
"Jack, please
Jack, don't go up"
"All you gotta do is trust me"
