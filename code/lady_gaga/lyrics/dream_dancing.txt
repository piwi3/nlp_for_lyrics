When shades unfold
The sunset's gold
And stars are bright above again
I smile, sweetheart
For then I know I can start
To live again
To love again

When day is gone
And night comes on
Until the dawn, what do I do?
I'll clasp your hand
And wander through slumberland
Dream-dancing with you

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time
Dream-dancing with you

Dream-dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream-dancing
To paradise prancing
Dream-dancing with you

Dream-dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream-dancing
To paradise prancing
Dream-dancing with you
