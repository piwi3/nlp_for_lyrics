Hush up
Don’t speak don’t wanna hear another
(Not another word from you)
You’re just a ani-
Mal tryin' to act real special
(But deep down you are just a shrew)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause its when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know I know I know I know you want me
Your just a pig inside a human body
Squealer squealer squeal out you’re so disgusting
You’re just a pig inside
Do ya I know I know I know I know you want me
Your just a pig inside a human body
Squealer squealer squeal out you’re so disgusting
You’re just a pig inside

Swine

Be that
Hog sweat it out you squealer
(Let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin-he
Love to watch her a** go wiggle
(It's the feel of ecstasy)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause its when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know I know I know I know you want me
Your just a pig inside a human body
Squealer squealer squeal out you’re so disgusting
You’re just a pig inside
Do ya I know I know I know I know you want me
Your just a pig inside a human body
Squealer squealer squeal out you’re so disgusting
You’re just a pig inside

Paint your face and
Paint his face and catch the beat
Paint your face and

Paint your face and
Be a swine just catch the beat
For the weekend
Catch the beat

C-catch the beat
