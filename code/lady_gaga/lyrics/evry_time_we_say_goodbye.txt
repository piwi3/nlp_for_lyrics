We love each other so deeply
That I ask you, the sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever, never to part

Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye
