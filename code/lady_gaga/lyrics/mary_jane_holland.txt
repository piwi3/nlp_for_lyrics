Lady of the ‘dam
Won’t be a slave to the blonde
Or the culture of the popular
She won’t, she won't
Sing at you I'll
Fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
I will, I will

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)
Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)

I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam (she won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo sit on my lyre, and
Play hIm like a piano man (I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)
Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)

I know that mom and dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because
I am rich as piss
When I ignite
And put you in my mouth
The grass heats up my insides and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)
Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)

Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)
Mary, Jane, Holland (whoh-who)
