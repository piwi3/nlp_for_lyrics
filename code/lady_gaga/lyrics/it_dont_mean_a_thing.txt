It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah

No, it don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah

Makes no diff'rence
If it's sweet or it's hot

Give it all that rhythm that you got

Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
(Tony) Got that

It makes no diff'rence
If it's sweet or hot

Just give that rhythm everything that you got

No, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah da
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
