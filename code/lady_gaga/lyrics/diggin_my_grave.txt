You're killing me, baby, with the things you do
Put me in the ground before we're through
Burnin' up this town
Spendin' everything I've saved, yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

Every little lie you tell, can't
Keep it hid
Just another nail on my coffin lid
Someone else is getting all the love you never gave, (woo) yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

So keep on runnin' 'round
Ain't no need to hurry back
'Cause I'll be gone from here
You'll be all dressed up in black
Six feet under, baby, that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cried drownin' in a tidal wave
You've been up all night
Diggin' my grave

So keep on runnin' 'round

Diggin' my grave
You've been up all night
Diggin' my grave

Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave
