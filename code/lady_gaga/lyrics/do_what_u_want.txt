Yeah
Oh (Turn the mic up)
Yeah (Eh) oh, oh

I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall, I
I stand up, and then I'm OK
But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream

So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body!

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in 'cause it's our life
(Well let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusha man, ya I got what you want
You want to escape, all of the crazy shit
You're the Marilyn I'm the president and
I love to hear you sing, girl

Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we lay in the cut like we don't give a f*ck!

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
Won't you come to my party
Girl what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (What you want with my body girl)
