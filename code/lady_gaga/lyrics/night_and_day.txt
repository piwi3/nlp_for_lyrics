Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of a stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me

And its torment won't be through (uh-huh)
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Day and night
Night and day
Day and night
Night and day
