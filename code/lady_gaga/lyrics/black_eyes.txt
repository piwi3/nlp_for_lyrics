Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for life
And everyone's waiting for you

And I'm gone, sitting by the phone
And I'm all alone by the wayside
And I'm gone, sitting by the phone
And I'm all alone by the wayside

By the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

Too far gone and I'm by the phone
And I'm all alone and I'm off alone
By the wayside
By the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
By the wayside

I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for life
And everyone's waiting for you
Everyone's looking at you
Everyone's looking at you
Everyone's looking for you
Everyone's waiting for you
