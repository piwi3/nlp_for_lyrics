Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak (me too)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

And I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through

To heaven (heaven), yes I'm in heaven (I'm in heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Go!

Dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through

To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Oh babe, when we're out together dancing
(Out together dancing)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
