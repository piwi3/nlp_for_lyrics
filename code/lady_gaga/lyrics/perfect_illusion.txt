Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)
(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
(Aah) you were a perfect illusion
(Aah) it was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion)

It was perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion
