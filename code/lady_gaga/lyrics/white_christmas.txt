I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

So, as you can tell, I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy
But I've decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse
So, I added one extra one
Here it goes

I'm dreaming of a white snowman
With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes
Oh, and when he cries, I'm gonna tell him, "It's okay"
Because Santa's on his sleigh and he's on his way

Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may all your days and Thanksgivings be so bright
And may all, all your Christmases be white

Okay, so, I suppose it's not very white outside yet
