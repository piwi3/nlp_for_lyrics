Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at me

Shit, this how you start of 09
Kickin' in the door, and I'm e'erybody problem
Stuntin' in some other Jordan nines
I got Phil Knight talkin' about "how you got them?"
Let's talk about the cars y'all got
You say you got alotta whips, well I got a lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me
You niggas mad cause you not me
I remain a giant while your Jeremy Shockey
And if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capice
D-C chillin', p-g chillin', floor to the ceilin'
Stuntin' in my billion-air, gear on my
Millionaire frames, that's money on my mind, wale!

Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at me
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at me
Yeah D-C chillin', P-G chillin'
My name wale and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get it

Yea, they keep sayin' whale but my name wale
Ho's call me "Mr. never wear the same thing"
You redundant, you never ever change
And I'm the same way, M-I-A
And me Cool and Dre get high like planes
Your man wale in his own damn lane
Can't control the box, you are no mills lane
Ain't heard D-C since sardines came
Ha! and I made y'all love it
We don't cop plea's, but y'all don't cop nuffin'
Police come around don't nobody say nuffin'
And you be with the cops, you niggas is Mclovin
Dark liquor til we busted
Til' I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullen
District of Columbia
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya!

Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me

My name wale and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get it
My name wale

Get 'em all, get 'em all, pack it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across that pond, they all know us
International, whoa!
Driving my car to a foreign place
Lookin' at me, nothin' on my face
We want it all now, we got it all yes
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at us

Dre, pick 'em, ah, pick 'em, I'll shut 'em all down
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point them out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin' be ballin' for all y'all to see
Ain't I something? the way I'm stuntin'
My material girls give 'em A-Rod money!
L-V on my luggage
Them bammas goin' hate, and I love it, f*ck 'em

Flier than the boys
Flier than the birds
Flyin' in the sky with the money in herds
We want it all now, we got it all yes
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at us

Flier than the boys
Flier than the birds
Flyin' in the sky with the money in herds
We want it all now, we got it all yes
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at us
