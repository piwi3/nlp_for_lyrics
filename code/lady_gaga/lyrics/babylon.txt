We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me ancient city style
We can party like it's B.C.
With a pretty sixteenth century smile

It's the thing thatcha bring
Thatcha bring, thatcha bring him
You and me, that's gossip

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it ancient city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!

B-B-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon
Battle for your life, gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon

Bodies moving like a sculpture
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to heaven
Speak in languages in a BloodPopÂ® moonlight

It's the thing thatcha bring
Thatcha bring, thatcha bring him
You and me, that's gossip (That's gossip)

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it ancient city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!

B-B-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon
Battle for your life, gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
B-B-Babylon
Battle for your life, Babylon!

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it ancient city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon!

Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it ancient city style
Talk it out, babble on
