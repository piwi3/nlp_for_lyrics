"Jack talked about how music
Is essentially twelve notes between any octave
Twelve notes and the octave repeats
It's the same story told over and over
Forever
All any artist can offer the world
Is how they see those twelve notes
That's it
He loved how you see them"

"Thank you for being here tonight
To honor my husband
He wrote a song for me
I'd like to sing it for him tonight
And with your help, maybe I can
Thank you, really, thank you"
