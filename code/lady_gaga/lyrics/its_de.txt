I feel a sudden urge to sing
The kind of ditty that invokes the Spring
So, control your desire to curse
While I crucify the verse

This verse I've started seems to me
The 'Tin Pan-tithesis' of melody
So, to spare you all the pain
We'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain
Come on

The night is young, the skies are clear
And if you want to go walkin', dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
I understand the reason why
You're sentimental 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

You can tell at a glance
What a swell night this is for romance
You can hear dear mother nature murmuring low
"Let yourself go"

Please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
"It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de-limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely"
