Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot volumes
I know a love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

Princess Die
I want to see her cry
Princess Die
Princess Die
We want to watch her cry
Princess Die

I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
Bob your head for another dead blonde who's real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

Princess Die
I want to see her cry
Princess Die
Princess Die
We want to watch her cry
Princess Die

The final act of life will be my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you
