I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

I always thought even though
We were so young we could grow
Up in the end it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy

I miss our cheap chandalier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russian scored
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair

I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open our last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy

I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The walkup we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work

I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating
I want one last night there
A Brooklyn night affair (a Brooklyn night affair)

It's not that I don't wanna love you
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn nights happy

It's not that I don't want to love you
'Cause I really tried, and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night adieu

Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night adieu
