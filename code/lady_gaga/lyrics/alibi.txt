Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow
Or tell me about my past
My heart is yours to borrow
Ain't nothing meant to last

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

Don't ask too many questions
You don't want answers to
You don't like my direction
Hell, I won't follow you

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin' daddy
That I had to run away
Looked him in the eyes
Said, "there ain't no other way"
So woman, if I tell you that I love you, be ok

'Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I love you in the morning
And when the day is done
But if you want my freedom
You know I'm bound to run

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin' daddy
That I had to run away
Looked him in the eyes
Said, "there ain't no other way"
So woman, if I tell you that I love you, be ok

'Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
