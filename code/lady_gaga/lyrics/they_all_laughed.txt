They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said "The world was round"
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said "Man could fly"

They told Marconi, wireless was a phony

It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon

But all you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy

They laughed at us and how!

Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
And now they're fighting to get in

They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin

They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie, he kept the laughers busy

That's how people are

They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, "Hello, Goodbye"

But all you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together

Darling, take a bow
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?
