Shawty, what yo' name is?

Them hustlers keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I'll let you film me

On your video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you like my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone
I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen

Them hustlers keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?
So press record, I'll let you film me

On your video phone
