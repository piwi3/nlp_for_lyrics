So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody!
So you gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you (Stop talkin' about this stuff)
And he broke it in little pieces, now how do you do? (That's not even funny Tony)

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night, goody goody!
So you found that loves a barrel of dynamite (I told you I'm not a goody, I'm a baddy)
Hurray and hallelujah, you had it comin' to ya (You think you're funny huh?)
Goody goody for you! Goody goody for me (Goody goody for you!)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you (That's what real chick is huh?)

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody! (I was confused you know?)
So you gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces (I know), now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night (Yeah, all night), goody goody!
So you think that loves a barrel of dynamite (Yeah, so what? Sometimes!)
Hurray and hallelujah, you had it comin' to ya (Stop lying)
Goody goody for you! Goody goody for me (I'm not a goody, I'm a baddy)
Your love has been denied, you've been taken for a ride (What? Are you happy now?)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you (Yeah, I'll be fine. Just stop singing that song!)
