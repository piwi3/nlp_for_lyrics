Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday night
Everybody drink a lotta whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow, we're on burlesque time
But everybody's gotta work tomorrow at nine

Touch me, t-touch me baby
But don't mess up my hair (o-o-o-o-oh)
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached
This is a brief affair

Vanity (o-o-oh)
Pictures in magazines, movie screens
Vanity (o-o-oh)
There is a camera, so many beauty queens
Vanity (o-o-oh)
It's so good to be populous and glamorous
We love ourselves and no one else

V-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-vanity
V-vanity
V-v-v-v-vanity

Nothing wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty 'cause this country's insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothing's quite as sexy as a woman this fine

Touch me, t-touch me baby
But don't mess up my hair (o-o-o-o-oh)
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached
This is a brief affair

Vanity (o-o-oh)
Pictures in magazines, movie screens
Vanity (o-o-oh)
There is a camera, so many beauty queens
Vanity (o-o-oh)
It's so good to be populous and glamorous
We love ourselves and no one else

Look at me (watcha lookin' at)
Look at me (watcha starin' at)
(2x)

(O-o-oh)
I'm comin' around, I'm sippin' on andre, it's time (o-o-oh)
I heard the cutie's in the back startin' the p-party line (o-o-oh)
Let's dance, quick round, we're in the vanity house
We'll cover the sequents, diamonds
We're happy 'cause we're shining

Touch me t-touch me baby
But don't mess up my hair (o-o-o-o-oh)
Love me l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached
This is a brief affair

Vanity (o-o-oh)
