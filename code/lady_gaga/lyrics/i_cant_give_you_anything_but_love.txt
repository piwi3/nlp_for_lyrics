I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, we're here to find
Happiness and I guess, all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
