Red one, Konvict
GaGa
Oh oh eh

I've had a little bit too much
All of the people start to rush(start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

Whats goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember but its alright, I'm a-alright

Just dance!
Gonna be okay
Dada doo doot-n
Just dance!
Spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n
Just dance!
Gonna be okay
D-d-d dance, dance, dance,just
J-J-Just dance!

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out (inside out right)
Control your poison babe
Roses have thorns they say,
And were all gettin' hosed tonight!

What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember but its alright, I'm alright

Dada doo doot-n
Just dance!
Spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalog
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call
I'm a hit up beat it up latch on to it until tomorrow yeah

Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the mean time stay let me watch you break it down

Just dance!
Gonna be okay
Dada doo doot-n
Just dance!
Spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n
Just dance!
Gonna be okay
D-d-d dance, dance, dance,just

Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic
