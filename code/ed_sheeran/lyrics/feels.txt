Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life (ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
For something real (you done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Drop it to the ground, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no lend
Gotta trust your crowd, get her layin' in the cloud, babe
(Baby, I got the feels) (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you do this to me (yeah)
I tried to tell 'em not to do it as loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave (yeah)
I was bangin' suicide for the rivers
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life (ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
For something real (you done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker (don't worry)
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (alright)
One day we'll get married in Las Vegas (nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (mm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never, ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I've ever really seen
And you give me this feel, if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
(Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Feels, yeah
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
