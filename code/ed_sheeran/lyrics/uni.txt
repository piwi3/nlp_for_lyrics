I found your hair band on my bedroom floor,
The only evidence that you'd been there before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore,
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high, 
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye,
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else,
I tip it to forget things about myself,
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that,
I never wanna settle down, come around, break up the love like Lego now,
Never wanna turn into another like you,
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views,
Everything's great but not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker 
Like every thing I say seems to all sound awkward,
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous,
On the surface,
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts,
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative 
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Woah
Woah 
Oh oh

Because, if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now,
And maybe I can let myself down, wo-oahh
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware, I keep my feet
On the ground and keep looking around, 
To make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low,
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered, 
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know god made another one of me to love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
