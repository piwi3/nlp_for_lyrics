It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh

Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Louder! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now not
Soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh

Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Louder! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance
But can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so hoped you'd take my hand, darling
Before the beats kicks in again
But can you feel it? 
Ooh oh-oh
Can you feel it? 
Oh no no no?

(Sing!) I need you darling (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Won't you let me know oh, oh, ooh ooh (louder!) (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Sing!) If you love me come on get involved (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh (louder!) (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
Sing!
