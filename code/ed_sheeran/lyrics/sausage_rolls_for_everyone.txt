Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Come and sing and dance to sausage rolls with me

Here we go, we are back
Trying to make history for charity
And may I introduce to you
Ed Sheeran and Sir Elton John
No pressure

Let's have a party, it's Christmas Day
Your mum's cooking turkey but been moaning since yesterday
The presents are open and the bin bags are put away
Just until Boxing Day
Let's dance, Merry Christmas

Get to the kitchen for sausage rolls
Kids, drop your toys and dance along to rock and roll
Everyone's here, and now the dog's got the trifle bowl
This is pure family goals
Let's sing, Merry Christmas (come on!)

The sausage rolls are on (yes, mate)
And our family are back, joined as one
We're having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the kids who have none
Sausage rolls for everyone
(Aye, sausage rolls, come on!)

Wishing that Christmas was here to stay
The last one was lovely, so I'm glad that it's come again
It won't be the same this year since loved ones have passed away
We miss them every day
Let's pray, Merry Christmas

Coming together for something good
We're singing in PJs, but we're helping the neighborhood
We came back with sausage rolls just like you knew we would
And doesn't my mate look good
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas

I feel my hunger comes
Every time the oven turns on
Filled up with so much love
Every pound for this song goes to helping the people along
Sausage rolls for everyone (yes, mate)

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time
(It's Christmas)
