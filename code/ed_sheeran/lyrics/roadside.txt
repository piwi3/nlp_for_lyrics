My lawyer's son died in his sleep last night
Got me thinking 'bout who I was in my past life
To be surrounded by so much pain
I understand my karma but why is theirs the same?
Two good people, two amazing sons
Just yesterday they had both, now they raising one
I look at the clouds and just think
I could lose mine or they could lose me in one blink
When I think one day it all ends, I start to drink
And fathom suicide 'cause I was almost on the brink
And it feel like my family been jinxed
Ever since I found my grandmother stiff, leaning over the kitchen sink
I could cry enough tears to float Noah's Ark
Perfect health but she died of a broken heart
And after that, it was domino effect
First my uncle, then my daddy, I guess I'm in line next

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the most high
'Cause He kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, momma don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside

How come you can't learn a lesson until you go through it?
How come you can think about the past but can't go to it?
If I could, I would float through it
Walk up to Triple X's BMW window and stick a note to it
Tell him to drive off, the devil coming
Ever since he fell from heaven, he been trying to settle something
I keep the faith and try not to question God
But I gotta problem when I see innocent people die
I sympathize with Jews, I sympathize with blacks
Sympathize with Natives, America's yours if you want it back
Where the hunger at?
Probably under a tree in Mississippi, by the river, where they hung us at
If Jesus walked, why we all running laps?
Feel like ending racism further than where the sun is at
A war to keep people from people, how dumb is that?
I guess we shouldn't put our thoughts on the front of hats

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the most high
'Cause He kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, momma don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside

Fall short and my soul will fly
Caught trippin' on the other side
I know it happen to me every time
Caught out on the roadside
Thumb high in the wind, ditch high
Tell my momma, I'ma be alright now
I'll be home in a few weeks, soon
'Til then, I'll sing this song to you

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the most high
'Cause He kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, momma don't cry
I was on the roadside

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the most high
'Cause He kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, momma don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside
