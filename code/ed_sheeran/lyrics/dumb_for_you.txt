I am just a man on my own
La da da da da da da
Tryin' find a place I belong
La da da da da da da
I don't want your money, I don't need no fancy clothes
I'd rather be with you when I am broke oooh-oooh
'Cause you use me
Just a little bit
You try to confuse me
When we're intimate
You'd rather accuse me
But I'm innocent
I'm not comin' loosely
Over sentiment

I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for loving you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for trusting in you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb when I'm done with you
'Cause ain't no one, one, one that can f*ck with you

They callin' me the people's champ
La da da da da da da
But everything you do is a shamp
La da da da da da da
I'd rather just hang with my friends
Sometimes I think things will change
And then I land in your bed
Then it don't feel like its the first time
Your everything I want and your not mine
You keep saying I do without them
I say put your money where your mouth is
Come back to me when it feels right
Get me so hard it makes me fight
One more time, just one more time, just one more time

I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for loving you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for trusting in you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb when I'm done with you
'Cause ain't no one, one, one that can f*ck with you

Real talk, I'm the white boy to you Wes Snipes
I'm East Coast but it's all love on the Westside
Your girlfriend is a close friend of my bedside
She want D's, and I ain't talking the breast size
Everybody in the club getting reckless
You go home at midnight, we stay out till breakfast
I cash checks and you cancel them
You make calls but there ain't nobody answering
I want a smart girl who gives brains like it's charity
Every night a Friday night, me and Lyla Garrity
On another level, ain't nobody that compare to me
These bitches going dumb trying to marry me

I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for loving you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for trusting in you
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb when I'm done with you
'Cause ain't no one, one, one that can f*ck with you

I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for loving you (I feel so dumb for loving you)
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb for trusting in you (I feel so dumb for trusting in you)
I feel dumb, dumb, dumb when I'm done with you
'Cause ain't no one, one, one that can f*ck with you
