Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
I'll take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
I'll make it disappear, dear

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand
If you'll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, on

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand
If you'll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

Now I'm missing you
I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I stopped eating food
And I squeezed into your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
