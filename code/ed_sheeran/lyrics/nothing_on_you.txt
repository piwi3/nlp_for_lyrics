I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
So I don't wanna leave here ever, no
She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a little romance," hey

You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
Or keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh my, my, my

I was rollin' up something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everythin' I need in this room
Smoke clouds and the scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you (uh, uh)
When you ain't got nothing on you (Londra con flow)

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, uh
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, uh
Desde que salimos por la tarde los dos
A besarnos los dos, hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemos los dos no se puede igualar
Parecemos ficción cuando entramos en acción
Esta peli de amor, no se acabar (yo), yeah
Pero lo que mata (ayy)
Es que esta noche nos vemos ahí en mi casa
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rollin' up something with you (woo!)
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everythin' I need in this room
Smoke clouds and the scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
When you ain't got nothing on you

Look
Take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard-to-get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Homegirl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I got a land the rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
Adn a mad persona, when I had her over
That outfit, it cost bread, I got the matchin' loafers
Why? 'Cause that's somethin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

I was rollin' up something with you (with you)
Kickin' back in the way that we do (ooh)
I got everythin' I need in this room (ah)
Smoke clouds and the scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you (no, no, no)
When you ain't got nothing on you

She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like, "Damn"
When you ain't got nothing on you
