If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I-I, I'm never gonna leave your life

Oh, I could never tell your lie
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my decisions
When I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again

Oh, I
I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I-I, I'm never gonna leave your life

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I-I, I'm never gonna leave your life

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
