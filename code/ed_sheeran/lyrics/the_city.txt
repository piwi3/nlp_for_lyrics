And this city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
And sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveler, oh oh, oh
This is now my home, my home
Oh oh, I'm burning on the back street
Oh oh, stuck here sitting in the backseat
Oh oh, and I'm blazing on the street
What I do is not up to you
'Cause if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two, yeah

The pavement is my friend
Hey, and it will take me where I need to go
'Cause I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
And I, I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

Oh, London calls me a stranger
A traveler
Oh oh, oh, oh oh
And this is now my home, my home
Oh oh, I'm burning on the back street
Oh oh, stuck here sitting in the backseat
Oh oh, and I'm blazing on the street
What I do is not up to you
'Cause if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
'Cause the black smoke
Gets your head into a muddle like
Walking into Elephant
Syringes in a puddle like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nose dives
Can't resort to arrogance
With white lines, no
And this city won't erase me
But I can't help to see just
How this dark city changed me
It's all the same see
Music is my life but
I try to fight
Whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West
London's my home now
Knees weak but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay away from all the negative shit
That will follow me

London calls me a stranger
Whoa, oh oh
This is not my home now, my home
Oh oh, I'm burning on the back street
Oh oh, stuck here sitting in the backseat
Oh oh, and I'm blazing on the street
What I do is not up to you
'Cause if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

Oh oh, I'm burning on the back street
Oh oh, stuck here sitting in the backseat
Oh oh, and I'm blazing on the street
What I do is not up to you
'Cause if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
