There's a new day

There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming (There's a new day)
There's a new day coming

Well I hear it in the distance
Like an angel calling me
I must be getting closer to finding my destiny
There's a road we must travel, oh the road wraps around
And every twist and turn, there's a new lesson to be found
There's a moment in your life
Point of no return
Where you hold onto your dreams
And let your, let your bridges burn

There's a new day coming (There's a new day)
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming (There's a new day, there's a new day coming)
There's a new day coming

There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming
