Own it, girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya

Lighters up, lighters up
One time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party
When you saw me I was lighting up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you're lighting up the rave
And it's feeling like I met you here before
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and the rest of it is yours
Mi amor, I

E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play
I know no wetin you dey do me
Because dey scatter my brain

Thug loving when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it just by looking in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist
I'm so in awe, girl, you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's yours, you know you

Own it, girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya

Lights down for the one I love
Right now, we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel how we feel together
She wanna kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was coming from
But we got the same mind
So I don't wanna waste time, bring it to me
My, my, that's what I need
That's right, kissing your cheek
One time
I used to love being alone but now I can't stand it
Reaching out my palm for you to put your hand in
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it
How you lighting up the room with your glow?

'Cause girl, you just own it, girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya

I'ma be right by
