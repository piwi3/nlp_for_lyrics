I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don’t wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
"Well Dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this"
It’s been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones, ah
But I don’t wanna miss home, ah
There’s nothing to save and he knows, ah
I’ll just runaway in the overnight

I’ve never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen lie
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I’m gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go

"How long you leaving?"
"Well Dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this"
It’s been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones, ah
But I don’t wanna miss home, ah
There’s nothing to save and he knows, ah
I’ll just runaway in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes
My dad wasn’t in with that plan too bit tired and turns to show up
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I don’t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hold that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from the skin to my bones, ah
But I don’t wanna miss home, ah
There’s nothing to save and he knows, ah
I’ll just runaway in the overnight
