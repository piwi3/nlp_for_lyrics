We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some

I finished the day
Spark

A face, a gate, a great hole
A tweak, a move to let go
Where to stay
It can be real
Hush no time our body feels
The move, it looks so right
She dance and knows how to get some
Wave into the camera
Posing on the bright light

We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some

A place, a day where do you go
We spend all the night on the dance floor
Now we know how you feel
Hush no doubt, no better deal
You rip it off (rip it off)
You pick me up (pick me up)
Share it, feel the powers
And let me know (let me know)
You're free to go (free to go)
Posing on the bright light

We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some
Wanna get some

We are beautiful

We are beautiful wanna get some get some
We are beautiful wanna get some get some

Wanna get some

We are beautiful
