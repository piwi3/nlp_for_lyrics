Let me get my chakras in order
Please stop plannin' my slaughter
I need you back in my corner
Why you burn that jacket I bought ya?
Those nights I sat in my Corsa
I was just tryna pattern my Sosa
Know me from way back then
You know me from way back when
Back when I would wish I was taller
Back when I would wish I was ballin'
Oh, I think this is my callin'
But bae ain't sayin', "Goodmornin'"
I'm just here tryna fix it
Got a toolbox full and no tools in
Anything I say gets twisted
Call off until the mornin'
 
Nights like these I could shed ten thousand tears
I fight for you, and you say I don't care
Go blind for you, and you say I don't see
Die for you and you would say I weren't there
 
And I don't need to say a word
Thinkin' about you all the time
I never meant to break your heart
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all the time

These are the nights where I sit on my own
Whiskey glass, ice cube, let me get in the zone
Like, let me get my chakras in order
Darkness in my spirit and my mind got me feelin' alone
Can you hear me from the outside lookin' in?
Can you see the way it was and what it could've been?
Can you see it in my bloodshot eyes?
For the last time, I'm not that guy
You've known me since before the hype
Before the birds, before the lights, the broken trust
Way before the business tore us up
We were just tryna scrape change in the corner shop
And I was tryna make waves, ended up on a mad one
Rainy gray days, every night was a sad one
Regret all or nothing, 'bout the things I have done
Family first, I'm a Catholic grandson, but
Fool me twice and then never again
We was so tight, the stitchin' frayed
I know in dark times we are one in the same
So you can relate to the struggle and pain, yeah
 
Nights like these I could shed ten thousand tears
I fight for you, and you say I don't care
Go blind for you, and you say I don't see
Die for you and you would say I weren't there

And I don't need to say a word
Thinkin' about you all the time
I never meant to break your heart
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all the time

How could I give reason to leave?
My baby the reason I breathe
Oh, I just weep and I weep
I haven't been able to sleep for a week
My memories of us are on replay
Hype and now I'm mad like a DJ
Try win this one but it just ain't easy
Just give me one gyal and I'm easy
Nuff gyal said they wan' see me
She can see me pon the TV
Nuff gyal said they wan' feed me
She don't wan' feed me, she wan' eat me
Dem gal are mad like, really
Cah my gyal are bad like Riri
Cyaan' see dem gal, yeah I'm Stevie, blind, deeply
 
Nights like these I could shed ten thousand tears
I fight for you, and you say I don't care
Go blind for you, and you say I don't see
Die for you and you would say I weren't there

And I don't need to say a word
Thinkin' about you all the time
I never meant to break your heart
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all the time

And do you think that's okay?
Do you think it's okay to play with my emotions?
You know I've got a good heart
You know I would do anything for you
And you just, you play on that so much
And how do you appreciate it?
Do you think appreciating it is
Comparing me to Sonya all the time?
Every time you get a chance 
To compare me to this great girl that
A ghost from the past, some girl that you was in love with
Do you think that's appreciating me?
