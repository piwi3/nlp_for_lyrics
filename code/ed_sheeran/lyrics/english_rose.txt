Across the sea 
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams

But I'd long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me

So I'll make my way 
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad 
On the phone it's amazing
From the street to the craziest places I've seen

But I'd long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me

I spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

I met a man 
In the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son
You know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

And I found truth 
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose
