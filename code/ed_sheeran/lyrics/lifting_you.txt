I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey hey
We're going for it (don't judge me)
Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me)
Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me)
Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out)

We've come to have a good time
And we won't compromise
We wanna hear the fellas
We wanna feel the lights
Automatic wine
My money stacked so high
If you sliced it like pie
Take the smallest slice
It'd still touch the sky

Tonight we're going turbo
The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo
We gonna need a lot of Merlot
But the question is where'd I just go

So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you

You ever seen one girl take over the night?
Take over the city and restore it's pride
If you're gonna roll a blunt
Then roll a blunt right
The room is too dark
Someone spark up the light
Police, got the strap on the side
My people still fly the kite
But I learned from my grandma
To master my eye
Oh shit I'm talking too much
I'm too fucking hyped
