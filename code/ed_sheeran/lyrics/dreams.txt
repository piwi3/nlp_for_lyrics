Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream

I saw a young G sitting on the wall
Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, "If you get life you're a fool"
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, "I'd rather do life, than have none at all"
He said, "Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool"
He said "Me, I slip once, then I'm through
You'd do the same if you was in my shoes"
I said, "Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die
He said, "Krept, I don't even like this stuff
But I'm in too deep, fam, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up"
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, "Krept, what's good, how's the music?"
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail "Brap, that's my niggas"
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious
Put your hands together and pray with us
Need to see my family more
So busy that they probably think that I don't love 'em
Probably telling people I forgot about my cousins
He's gone to Hollywood now, man so f*ck him
Man I'm stuck

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things it's giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye

In New York I met my big sis for the first time (first time), imagine that
I'm 24, it's the first time she sees me
Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes
And said she wished that he still was alive (alive)
She said, your mum sent you Jamaica (Jamaica)
She told me you came back ill (back ill)
Yeah I know you ain't been back still
But you know your friend over there got killed (got killed, killed)
I know she always had love for me (love for me)
Then she said something that stuck with me (stuck with me)
"Dad said you gotta keep the music alive"
Then she gave the the look like it's up to me (up to me, up to me)
It hit me hard, didn't show it though
Thinking 'bout it on the plane, going home (going home)
Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down (let him down, let him down)
Before I stepped out the house
My niece said "Make sure you come back again"
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them (on them, on them)
We spoke about everything (everything)
And how his wife's tryna take everything (everything, everything)
All the inheritance (inheritance)
All because he gave her a wedding ring
So God forgive me for the minor things
Cause you'll risk everything when you're tryna win
And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things

(Dream chasing) stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things it's giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye (say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye)
One can dream (dream, dream, dream)
