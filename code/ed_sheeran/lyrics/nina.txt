I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high, two cars, we needed to breathe
We used each other’s edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You’d be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
'Cause every day when I was a baby
Don’t you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to burrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing
You call me selfish, I don’t understand
But I can’t help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day we’ll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)
And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)
And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now
