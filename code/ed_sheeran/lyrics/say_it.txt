Just keepin' it honest
You wouldn't want a young man if I wasn't whippin' this foreign
That's why I came back, top down

You gon' have to do more than just (say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (do it)
'Lil mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)
You gon' have to do more than just (say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (do it)
'Lil mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)

You know, you know
In this foreign car whippin' out
You know, you know
In this foreign car let you go

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that it's made
And I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare

Come and let me get down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin round on it, yeah
Even though you know that I just want you
Darling I promise the truth
And when I come down on it, yeah
You love when I'm down on it, yeah
F*ck around, spend time on it, yeah
That's why I came back top down

You gon' have to do more than just (say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (do it)
'Lil mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)
You gon' have to do more than just (say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (do it)
'Lil mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)

In this foreign car whippin' now

In this foreign car let it go

Got to break it down for you
let you know you know the things I'm down for
Ain't goin' act like you ain't bout
My door you know ain't open girl you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you out
Won't hesitate to take the time to waste no baby
Streamin' out, the foreign out to play
You know it's things it takes

So let me get down on it, yeah
Love when you spin round on it, yeah
Even though you know I just want you
Darling I promise the truth
And when I come down on it, yeah
