You and I, two of a mind
This love’s one of a kind
You and I, we’re drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I, learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I, we’re lifted over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
