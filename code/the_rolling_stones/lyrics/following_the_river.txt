There's something I should tell you
Why don't you sit there in that chair
You're looking good today
I love the way your comb's tucked in your hair

My cards are on the table, but the drinks have all run out
There's been some other lads in this room with me, we're really quite a crowd
It's hard to break it gently, but I really thought it through
I don't think there's much future left, for me and you, me and you

I've been following the river, until it joins hands with the sea
I've been thinking of you so bad
Because you always saw the best in me (you always saw the best in me)

You'll probably forget me, and I'll fade back in the bar
Just a face disappearing without trace, I'll be lost, I'll be lost
One day I'll hear some laughter in a out-of-town cafe
I'll be reaching for your number
I'll be calling out your name, calling out your name

I've been following that river, to join hands with the sea
I've been thinking of you all the time
'Cause you always saw the good in me
I'll be following the river - oh my! 
'Til it spills out in the sea

When I first think about you, oh dear
'Cause you always saw the best in me (always saw the best in me)

I'll be following the river (yeah!)
To join hands with the sea
Ah, if I can't have you, I'll be dreaming all about you
Because you always saw the best in me
I'll be following the river, oh oh oh to join hands with the sea
I'll be thinking about you, because you always brought the best in me
