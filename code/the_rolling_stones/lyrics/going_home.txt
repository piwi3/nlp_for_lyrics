Spendin' too much time away 
I can't stand another day 
Maybe you think I've seen the world 
But I'd rather see my girl 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I am 

All those letters every day 
Are maybe alright in their way 
But I'd love to see your face 
When I get home in their place 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I am 
Alright

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome bome 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I will 

When you're three thousand miles away 
I just never sleep the same 
If I packed my things right now 
I could be home in seven hours 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome bome 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 

Yes, I will 
Yes, I will 
See my baby, see my baby

I just can't wait, I just can't wait
