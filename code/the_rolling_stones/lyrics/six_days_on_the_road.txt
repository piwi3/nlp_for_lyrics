Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh 
Rollin' down the Eastern seaboard
I got my diesel wound up 
And she's a-runnin' like never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright 
But I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road 
And I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got ten forward gears 
And a George Overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills 
And my eyes are opened wide
I just passed a Jimmy and White
I been passin' everythin' in sight
Six days on the road 
And I'm gonna make it home tonight

SOLO 

Well it seems like a month since 
I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women 
But I'm not like some other guys
I could find me one to hold me tight
But I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road 
And I'm gonna make it home tonight

The FBI is checkin' on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight 
But my log books way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight
I'm gonna dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road 
And I'm gonna make it home tonight

SOLO

My rigs a little old but 
That don't mean she's slow
There's a good flame blowin' 
From her smoke stack, black as coal
Well my home town's commin' in sight
And if you think I'm happy, you're right
Six days on the road 
And I'm gonna make it home tonight
