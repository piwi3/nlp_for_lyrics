Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me

Standing in the kitchen
Looking way out cross the fields
You see a face in the window
It's not real, it's not real

Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me, stay away
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use, stay away from me
Stay away
Ain't no use in crying, stay away from me
Stay away

Standing at the station
And gazing down the track
There ain't no train coming baby
I ain't never, never coming back

Standing in the balcony
Looking way out towards the sea
If you see your ship come a sailing
It's not me, it's not me
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me
Stay away from me

Ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me
