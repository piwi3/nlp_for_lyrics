I'm gonna leave you, baby
Before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you, baby
Before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me
But woman, it was just not my time

You put poison in my coffee
Instead of milk or cream
You put poison in my coffee
Instead of milk or cream
You're 'bout the evilest woman
That I ever seen

Yeah, I'm gonna leave you, baby
Yeah, before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you, woman
Before I commit a crime
Yeah, you tried so hard to kill me
But woman, it was not, it was not my time
