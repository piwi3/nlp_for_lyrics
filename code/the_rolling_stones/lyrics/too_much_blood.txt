I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
To make some love
I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
And make some love

I can feel it in the air
Feel it up above
Feel the tension everywhere
There is too much blood
Too much blood, well alright

Everything you see
On the movie screen is tame
Everything's gonna be arranged

A friend of mine was this Japanese
Who had a girlfriend in Paris
He, he had to date her for six months
And eventually she said yes

You know, he took her to his apartment
Cut off her head, put the rest of her body
In the refrigerator, ate her piece by piece
Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the freezer

And when he ate her he took her bones
To the Bois de Boulogne
By chance, a taxi driver noticed him
Burying the bones, you don't believe me?
Truth is stranger than fiction
We drive through there everyday

I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
Be number one, yeah!
I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
And have some fun

I can feel it everywhere
Feel it up above
Feel the tension in the air
There is too much blood, too much blood
Too much, yeah, too much blood, a'right

Did you ever see 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'?
Horrible, wasn't it?
You know people ask me, "Is it really true
You know where you live in Texas
Is that really true what they do around there, people?"

I say, "Hey, now everytime I drive through the crossroads
I get scared there's a bloke running around
With a fuckin' chain saw
Oh, no, he's gotta cut off me
Oh no no! Don't saw off me leg, don't saw off me arm"

When I go to the movies, you know
I'd like to see something more romantic
You know like, 'An Officer And A Gentleman'
Or something, something you excite the wife too
You know what I mean?

I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
And have some fun
I wanna dance, I wanna sing
I wanna bust up everything
And make some love

I can feel it everywhere, feel it up above
Feel the tension in the air
There is too much blood
Too much blood, alright!

Pretty ladies, don't be scared
Pretty ladies, don't be scared
Pretty ladies, don't be scared, yeah

Pretty ladies, don't despair
Pretty ladies, don't despair
There's still so much love

Yeah, too much, too much, yeah
Too much blood, too much blood
Too much, too much blood
Too much blood, too much blood
Too much blood, too much blood
