You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love 
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of 
But who are you to tell her who to love? 
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above 
You better move on 

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings 
But I believe she's happy with me without those things 
Still you beg me to set her free 
But my friend, that will never be 
You better move on 

Now I don't blame you for lovin' her 
But can't you understand? Man, she's my girl 
And I, I'm never never ever gonna let her go 
'Cause I, yeah, I love her so 

Well I think you better go now, I'm gettin' mighty mad 
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had 
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so 
I'm never gonna let her go 
You better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on
