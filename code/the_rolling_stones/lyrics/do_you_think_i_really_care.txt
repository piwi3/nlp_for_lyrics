Yeah here I come

Do you think that I really care
About a girl who's never there
Do you think that I ever care
About a girl who's never there

But I see you on the subway
I see you on the D train
Hey, see her in the afternoon
Just after the Giants game

I see her on the freeway
Long Island Expressway
Hey, give me a break, baby
Help me get out of this rain

Ah, do you think that I really care
About a girl who's never there
Do you think that the clothes she wears
Make me forget she ain't never there

I saw her on a runway
Saint Patrick's on a Sunday
I saw her eating pizzas
On 57th and Broadway

I see her on the highway
I see her on the SkyTrain
Yeah I need a Yellow Cab, hey
Help me get out of this rain, yeah

Whoa baby

I saw you in The Factory
Like it's some kind of allergy
I saw you in the back of Max's Kansas City
Propping up the bar on Saturdays

Met you at the gallery
It ended up in anarchy
You was spray painting silk screens
And double dosed up with flattery

Do you think that I would ever care
For a girl who's never there
Is it possible that the jewels she wears
Change my mind if she dyed her hair

Do you think that the clothes she wears
Make me forget that you're never, never there 
Do you think that I really care?
See her hanging out on 57th and Broadway

Hey, do you think I would ever care
For a girl, for a girl who's never there

Wait a minute, I need a Yellow cab, let me get out of this rain
Hey, put your umbrella up your ass, baby, whooo!

Do you think I could ever ever care
