Fannie Mae
Baby won't you please come home?
Fannie Mae
Baby won't you please come home?
I don't wanna, but Christ, that girl is gone

Well I hear her singin' 
Way on down the line
Well I hear her singin' 
Way on down the line
Well, she just keeps singin', just lovin' and lovin' and tryin', oh yeah   

Won't somebody tell me, tell me what's wrong with me?
Won't somebody tell me, tell me what's wrong with me?
Since Fannie's been gone, my life has been misery

Oh, Fannie Mae
Baby won't you please come home?
Fannie Mae
Baby won't you please come home?
I'm in so much misery since that girl's been gone
