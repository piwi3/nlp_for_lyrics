I said the joint was rockin'
A goin' round and round 
Yeah, reelin' and a rockin'
What a crazy sound 
And they never stopped rockin'
'Til the moon went down 

Well it sounds so sweet 
I had to take me a chance 
Rose out of my seat 
I just had to dance 
Started movin' my feet 
Whoa to clappin' my hands 

I said the joint was rockin'
Goin' round and round 
Yeah, reelin' and a rockin' 
What a crazy sound 
And they never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down 

Yeah at twelve o'clock 
Yeah the place was packed 
Front doors was locked 
Yeah the place was packed 
And when the police knocked 
Those doors flew back 

But they kept on rockin'
Goin' round and round 
Yeah, reelin' and a rockin' 
What a crazy sound 
And they never stopped rockin'
'Til the moon went down 

And they go on rockin' 
Goin' round and round 
Yeah, reelin' and a rockin'
What a crazy sound 
And they never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down 

Well the joint stayed a rockin' 
Goin' round and round 
Yeah, reelin' and a rockin' 
What a crazy sound 
And they never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down
