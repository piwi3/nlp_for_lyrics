You gotta dig it baby

Yes, yes, yes know the deserts couldn't hold all 
the love that I have in my heart for you
If I could spread it out across the sea 
you know my love would cover it all up
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Now if the cooks in the kitchen had a dress as tight yours, 
they wouldn't need a fire
Ain't a word I could say just describe 
your fine looks and loving desire
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Baby you got a smile, so rare
You got a kiss, so good
You got a hug, so nice
Whole lot of loving, baby, baby
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Now if the bees only knew how sweet your love was, 
they'd pack up their honey comb
If the birds ever heard how sweet your voice was, 
they'd pack up their song, yeah
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Baby, ain't that kindness
Baby, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness
Got to tell you that's all kindness
We got to get it together now
We got to get it all together
Baby, ain't that a whole lot of loving
Woman, ain't that a whole lot of loving
Baby, ain't that a loving
Baby, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness

Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody please
Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody please
Somebody, somebody somewhere
Somebody, somebody tell me
We got to have a lot of loving

Know the desert couldn't hold all the love that I have in my heart for you
If I could spread it out across the sea I know my love would cover it all up
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
