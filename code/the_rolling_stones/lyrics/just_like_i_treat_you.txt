Some say you will
Some say you won't
Some say you do
Some say you don't
But I know
I know what you been through
You're gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you

Some say you can't
Some say you can't
Some say you is
Some say that you ain't 
But I know
know what you been through 
I'm gonna treat your baby, just like I treat you

If I give you little
It can give back
If I give you lots
I know what you'll be like
But I know
Know what you been through
You're gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you

Some say you're fine
Some say you're sad
Some say you're hot
Some say you're bad 
But I know
Know what you been through
You're gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you

I gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you
