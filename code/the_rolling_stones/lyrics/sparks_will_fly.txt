You'd better grease up 
I'm coming back 
Gonna catch fire 
Pyromaniac 
You'd better shape up 
You'd better get set 
Gonna burn up 
In the smoke of a jet 

Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back to you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back to you baby 
Ooh, you're gonna find out 
Oh, gonna scream and shout 
We're gonna pierce through this drought 
Sparks will fly, yeah, sparks will fly 

I'm gonna stand back 
The flames are high 
I better get help 
Can't stop the fire 
Bell's going to ring 
Hear the alarms 
Better tell the fire chief 
To quit playing cards 

Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Ooh, I'm gonna step on the gas 
I want to get there really fast 
Ooh, I wanna f*ck your sweet ass 
Sparks will fly 
Sharks will cry 
Sparks will fly 

I had a good sniff around 
Along old hunting grounds 
But I have never found 
A woman so hot 

Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back to you, baby 
Ooh, my fingers are crossed 
The time that we lost 
I'm in total chaos 
And sparks will fly 
Sparks will fly 
Oh yeah
Sparks will fly
Sparks will fly, yeah
Sparks will fly (back on you, baby)
Sparks will fly (sparks will fly)
Come on, come on (sparks will fly)
Come on, come on, come on, come on (sparks will fly)
Oh yeah, sparks will fly, oh yeah
