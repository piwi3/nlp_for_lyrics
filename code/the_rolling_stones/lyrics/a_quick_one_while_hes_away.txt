Her man's been gone
Fort night on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Her man's been gone
Fort night on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known, right here in town
Your town is very famous for the little girl
Whose cries can be heard all around the world

Ooh
Ooh

We have a remedy
You'll appreciate
No need to be so sad
He's only late

We'll bring you flowers and things
Help pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
Then he can fly to you

Fa la, la la, la la
Fa la, la la la
Fa la, la la, la la
Fa la, la la la
Fa la, la la, la la
Fa la, la la, la la

We have a remedy
Fa la, la la, la la
We have a remedy
Fa la, la la, la la
We have a remedy
Fa la, la la, la la

Little girl guide
Why don't you stop your crying?
Here comes Ivor
The dirty old sooty engine driver
To make you feel all right

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
Let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon 
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

Soon be home
Soon be home (oh yeah)
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

Soon be home
Soon be home 

Dang, dang, dang 
Dang, dang, dang 
Dang, dang

Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello

I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

Know that she's biblacized

Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven
Know you're forgiven
