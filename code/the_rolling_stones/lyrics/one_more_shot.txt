Uh baby, I've got a message for you
You got me doin' something
I thought I’d never will do
Give me one more 
One more shot
And it’s all I got
Give me one more shot

And take me back
I’m all yours, Jack
Yeah you got me freakin’
Yeah I’m over heated
Just when things are sweet
You can’t meet on the street

Give me one more 
One more shot
Yeah and it’s all I got
And don't let it ... on me 
One more shot

I’ll make your play
Yeah, make my day
Put me in correction for my own protection
In your jurisdiction spare the crucifixion

Give me one more shot
Baby it’s all I got
Baby don’t freeze up on me
One more shot

I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

One more shot
Give me one 
Give me one more shot
Yeah and it’s all I got
Just one more
One more shot
Give me one 
Give me one more, one
Give me one more shot
Yeah, babe
Give me one more shot
Na na na na na na na na na
Give me one more shot
