I've been holdin' out so long
I've been sleepin' all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you sometime

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starrin' in my dreams
Lord, I miss you, child
I've been waitin' in the hall
Been waitin' on your call
Your phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah

Oh everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come on, come on

I've been walking Central Park
Singin' after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I won't miss you, child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you, child
You've just been blottin' out my mind
Foolin' on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah
Lord, I miss you child

Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah
Lord, I miss you, child
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah
Lord, I miss you, child
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah
