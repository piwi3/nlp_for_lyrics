Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 

Well I went to see the gypsy 
To have my fortune read 
She said, "man, your baby gonna leave you 
Her bags are packed up under the bed" 
That's right 

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 

But if you leave me baby 
Girl, if you put me down 
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river, child 
And jump overboard and drown 
That's right 

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 

I said hey, hey, baby, hey, hey, now 
What you tryin' to do? Huh
Hey, hey baby, hey, hey now 
Please don't say we're through, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 

But if you stay, baby 
I tell you what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna work two jobs, seven days a week 
And bring my money home to you 
That's right 

Have mercy, please, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me, yeah

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me
