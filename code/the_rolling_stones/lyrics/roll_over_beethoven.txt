Well, I'ma write this letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's the jamminest record  
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blown a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I've got the rollin' arthritis
Sittin' down, had a rhythm review 
Roll over Beethoven, they rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel, like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further, then reel and rock it
Wind another
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues, wah

Yeah, roll over in the mornin' and give him a warnin'
Won't you step on my high heel boots?
Oh damn diddle, I am playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
Ya oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues
