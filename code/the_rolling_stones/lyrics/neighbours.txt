Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Neighbors, have I got neighbors?
Have I got neighbors?
All day and all night

Neighbors
Have I got neighbors?
Ringing my doorbells
All day and all night

Ladies, have I got crazies?
Scheming young babies
No piece and no quiet
I got T.V.'s, saxophone playing
Groaning and straining
With the trouble and strife

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight

Neighbors, do unto strangers
Do unto neighbors
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight

Neighbors do unto strangers
Do unto neighbors what you do to yourself
Yourself, yourself, yourself
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors, neighbors

Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Neighbors, do yourself a favor
Don't you mess with my baby
When I'm working all night
You know that neighbors
Steal off my table
Steal off my table
And doing alright, alright, alright, alright

Neighbors do unto strangers
Do unto strangers
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself
Your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, alright
