In the merry month of May
From me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam
Sad and brokenhearted

Salute me father dear
And kissed me darling mother
Then drank a pint of beer
Me tears and grief to smother

Off to reap the corn
Leave where I was born
I cut a stoat black thorn
To banish ghosts and goblins

In a pair of brand new brogues
Rattled over the bogs
I frightened all the dogs
On the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da

In Dublin next arrived
And thought it such a pity
To be so soon deprived
A view of that fair city

Then I took a stroll
All amongst the quality
Me bundle it was stole
In that neat locality

Something crossed me mind
When I looked behind
No bundle I could find
Upon me stick a wobbling

Inquiring after the rogue
Said me Connaught Brogue
Was not much in vogue
On the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five 
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da

The boys of Liverpool
When we safely landed
Called myself a fool
I could no longer stand it

Me blood began to boil
Me temper I was losing
For old Erin's isle
They began abusing

Horah say I
Me shelelagh I let fly
Galway boys were by
They saw I was a hobbling

With a loud hurray
They joined in the affray
We quickly cleared the way
For the rocky road to Dublin

One two three four five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
Nd all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da
