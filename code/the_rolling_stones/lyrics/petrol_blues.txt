Please Mr. President, say it isn't so
I don't have to sell my Cadillac that I just paid for
I talk to Mr. Getty and I talk to Standard Oil
They say they got plenty
But they ain't gonna part for no more

My friend says the trouble is this country's too Goddamn big
Maybe we should pull it in from the ages a bit
Maybe that way we'll have so far to go

I called Mr. Getty, I even called-up Texaco, Texaco
They got plenty left, they got, plenty to go
Hey Mr. President, say it isn't so
Aw, Mr. President, say it isn't so

Why do I have to sell my Cadillac I just paid for
I just paid for
