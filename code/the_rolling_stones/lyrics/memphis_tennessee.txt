Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party tryin' to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
'Cause the phone boy took the message and he wrote it on the wall 

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge 

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mama did not agree
She tore apart a happy home in Memphis, Tennessee 

Well last time I saw Marie, she's wavin' me goodbye
With "hurry home" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
Oh try to get her number back in Memphis, Tennessee
