She confessed her love
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on mercer street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens and Manhattan
And The Bronx and Staten Island
I canâ€™t forget New Jersey and Long Island
And all over the world, we came to rock for everybody like this

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen, anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out, I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around (lost, lost and never found)
I must have called her a thousand times
Sometimes I think she's just in my imagination

Lost in the crowd
