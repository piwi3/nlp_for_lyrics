[Chorus:]
Oh, Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby 
Don't ya know I in need of thee 
You don't believe it true 
Why don't you love me, too 
Its so long I've been waiting 
For you to come right in 
Now that we are together 
Is make my joy run over 

Yeah [Repeat: x7]

{Chorus]
Oh Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby 
Don't ya know I in love with you 
You don't believe I know 
So why don't you try me 
I'm never gonna let you down 
Never make you wear no frown 
You say you love me madly 
Then why do you treat me badly 

Yeah [Repeat: x7]

Oh Cherry, oh Cherry, oh baby 
Don't ya know I in love with you 
You don't believe I know 
So why don't you try me (try me) 
I'm never gonna let you down no 
Never make you wear no frown 
You say you love me madly 
Then why do you treat me badly 

Yeah [Repeat: x3]
