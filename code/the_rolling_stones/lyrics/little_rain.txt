A little rain fallin'
A little clock keep away the time
A little rain fallin'
A little clock keep away the time
Well now, a little rain keep a-fallin'
On this little love of mine

Little flowers open
Little birds keep a-singin' tune
A little flower open
A little birds keep-a singin' tune
I would like to love ya baby, underneath the shinin' moon
