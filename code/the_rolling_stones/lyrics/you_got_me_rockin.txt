I was a butcher cutting up meat 
My hands were bloody, I'm dying on my feet 
I was a surgeon 'till I start to shake 
I was a-falling 'till you put on the brakes 

Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 

I was a pitcher down in a slump 
I was a fighter taken for a sucker punch 
Feeling bad, guess I lost my spring 
I was the boxer who can't get in the ring 

Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking, alright 

I was a hooker losing her looks 
I was a writer can't write another book 
I was all dried up dying to get wet 
I was a tycoon drowning in debt, I said 

I said ah, hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me 
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
 
That's all, really 
Come on, come on

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't
Don't stop
Oh
Keep it going now 
Come on
Yeah, ay
