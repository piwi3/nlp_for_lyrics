I want to do is to get back to you. 

[Chorus]
Connection, I just can't make no connection. 
But all I want to do is to get back to you. 

Everything is going in the wrong direction. 
The doctor wants to give me more injections. 
Giving me shots for a thousand rare infections 
And I don't know if he'll let me go 

[Chorus: x2]

And I don't know if he'll let me go 
Connection, I just can't make no connection. 
But all I want to do is to get back to you.

My bags they get a very close inspection. 
I wonder why it is that they suspect me 
They're dying to add me to their collections 
And I don't know if they'll let me go 

Connection, connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you. 
Connection, I just can't make connection. 
But all I want to do is to get back to you

Do is to get back to you.
Connection, I just can't make no connection. 
But all I want to do is to get back to you.
