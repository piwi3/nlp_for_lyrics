Button your lip, baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Go for the throat

Let's bury the hatchet
And wipe out the past
And make love together
Stay on the path 

You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean 

This coming and going
Is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing
Is hurting my guts

The get off the fence now
You're creasing your butt
Life is a party
Let's get out and strut, yes

You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean 

You're not the only one
That's feeling lonesome
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions 

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Let's grab the world
By the scruff of the neck
And drink it down deeply
And love it to death

So button your lip, baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Let's rock 'n' roll yeah

You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean

You're not the only one
That's feeling lonesome
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
Mixed emotions

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

You're not the only one
You're not the only one

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
