And think I'm going mad
And I think I'm going mad

Life goes by so fast
Time whirls by so fast
You think I whine so
All the women come and go

Think I'm going mad
Think I'm going mad
Think I'm going crazy

All the highs and lows don't mean a thing to me
Don't give a damn

And season that'll pass
Think gon' be my last
I know my mind's afloat
Sometimes I feel so young and sometimes I feel so old

And I, think I'm going mad
And think I'm going mad, uh
Think I'm going crazy

All the highs and lows don't mean a thing to me
Don't give a damn

You think I'm going

Yeah, you want to see, you want to see all the kids all laugh
But they're thinking, and they think I'm going crazy
But I think and I think I'm going crazy

All the highs and lows don't mean a thing to me
Don't give a damn

Don't think I'm going crazy
Think, going crazy

I can't even drink straw cup of coffee
Think I lost my head
I think I should be sacrificed
Think I should be put to rest
Save yourself
And think, I think I'm going 
And to think I'm going mad
Oh, and I think I'm going mad
