Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, buddy

Dropping names and telephone numbers and all

The pool's in but the patio ain't dry

My tits and ass with soul, baby
She's my little rock 'n' roll
Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, yeah
You got to shock them, show them
She's my little rock 'n' roll, yeah
Shock, shock, shock, oh my, my, my

Well, the sense is sensing that the juice keeps pumping and I know why
