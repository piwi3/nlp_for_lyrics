Begin to run aroun'
You better get you somebody 
Put her down, better let her go
Just as quick as you can

You know my woman got me on a wonder 
Somethin' I can't understan'

After all

You know that the hoo doo girl

Spend it all over town
When I wants to love her, now she ain't can be foun'

Dryin' tears away with my han'
You know that little hoo doo girl
She outhoodoo the hoo doo man
