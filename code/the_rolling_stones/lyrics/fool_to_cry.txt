When I come home baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee, and she says
Daddy what's wrong?
She whispers in my ear so sweet
You know what she says, she says
Ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

Daddy you're a fool
You know, I got a woman (daddy you're a fool)
And she lives in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She says, tell me all your troubles
You know what she says?
She says, ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

Daddy you're a fool to cry
Yeah, she says
Oh, Daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

She says, ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry

Even my friends say to me sometimes
And make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say?
They say, ooh daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why, ah

I'm a fool baby, ah ya
I'm a certified fool, ah yeah
Gotta tell ya, baby
I'm a fool baby, ah yeah
Whoo
Certified fool for ya, mama, ya, yeah, come on, yeah
