Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back
For a little more

You got my heart, you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
You got the diamonds, from the mine
Well that's all right
It'll buy some time

Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
Feeling foolish and that's for sure
Just waiting here
At your kitchen door?

Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?
I don't care,
No, I don't care

Oh babe, you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
If that's your love, it just made me blind
I don't care
No, that's no big surprise
