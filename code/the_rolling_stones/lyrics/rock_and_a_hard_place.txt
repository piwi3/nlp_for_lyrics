The fields of Eden
Are full of trash
And if we beg and we borrow and steal
We'll never get it back
People are hungry
They crowd around
And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock 
And a hard place

This talk of freedom
And human rights
Means bullying and private wars and chucking all the dust into our eyes
And peasant people
Poorer than dirt
Who are caught in the crossfire, and got nothing to lose but their shirts, yeah

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock 
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Between a rock 
And a hard place

We're in the same boat
On the same sea
And we're sailing south
On the same breeze
Building dream churches
With a silver spires
And our rogue children
Playing loaded dice

Between a rock
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Yeah, get a load of that

Give me the truth now
Don't want no shame
I'd be hung drawn and quartered for a sheep just as well as a lamb

Stuck between a rock
And a hard place
A rock and a hard place
You'd better stop 
Put on a kind face
Oh yeah
Can't you see, what you've done to me

Between a rock
And a hard place
(That's what I said)
Between a rock
And a hard place
(Yeah)
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Yeah! 
Don't you believe anymore
Yeah! Come on now! Yeah
Between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place
