Fling you out into orbit 
No one's gonna hear you shout 
The fool ain't gonna follow 
He don't even sleaze about 

Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine 

The elephant's in the bedroom 
Throwing all his weight about 
And I'm locked in the bathroom 
Your screams are gonna drown me out 

Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine
Oh yeah

I got a cold chill 
I get a cool thrill 
Are you ready for the gilded cage 
Are you ready for the tears of rage 
Come on baby, don't let them drown you out
Oh yeah

Sad sad sad 
Bad bad bad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine 

Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine

You're gonna be fine 
You're gonna be fine

You're gonna be fine fine fine
You're gonna be fine fine fine
Fine fine fine
Fine fine fine
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Gonna be fine fine fine
Fine fine fine
Fine fine fine
