You don't know what's going on 
You've been away for far too long 
You can't come back and think you are still mine 
You're out of touch, my baby 
My poor discarded baby 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
You are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

The girl who wants to run away, discovers that she's had her day
It's no good thinking that you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby, my poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
Yes you are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

You thought you were a clever girl giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no
You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
Yes, you are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Sing your song

Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

You don't know what's going on 
You've been away for far too long 
But you can't come back and think you are still mine 
You're out of touch, my baby 
My poor discarded baby 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
Yes you are all left out 
Yes you are, I said you're 
Left out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

Alright
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
