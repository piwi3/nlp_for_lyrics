Give me a reefer when I want to get high
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a reefer when I want to get high
Give me a woman when I get lonely
And set her right down here by my side (well, your turn)

When a man want to smoke a little dope (hey Mick)
Lord there shouldn't be no law 
When a man want to smoke a little dope

Yeah, every time I get high
Yeah, I lay my head down on my baby's breast (well)
Every time I get high
I want to lay down on my baby's breast

Well you know she hugged and kissed me, baby
She said Buddy Guy you are the best

I want to get high this mornin', Mick
Just to sho' is my name
You can bet my bottom dollar, Keith
I ain't gonna use no cocaine

Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a weed when I want to get high
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a reefer when I want to get high
Give me a woman when I get lonely
Lay down by my baby's side

Give me a woman when I get lonely
