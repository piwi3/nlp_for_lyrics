Well, she comes from Tallahassee, she's got a hi-fi chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy but to me she's really classy
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.

Well, she dances to the bop, cha-cha rag-a-mop
Dances to the shake, rocks the bunny hop, woh, woh, woh, woh
Well, she dances to the shake, dances to the stroll
Dances to the beat, she can rock and roll

She's my Tallahassee Lassie, oh, she comes from Tallahassee
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.

Well, she dances to the bop, cha-cha rag-a-mop
Dances to the blues, rocks the bunny hop, woh, woh, woh, woh
Now, she dances to the shake, dances to the stroll
Dances to the beat, she can rock and roll

My Tallahassee Lassie, oh, she comes from Tallahassee
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.

Oh, come on baby, come on darlin', come on sugar, come on darlin'
Yeah, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.

Come on baby, come on sugar, come on darlin', come on baby
Oh, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.

Oh, yeah, come on baby, come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on darlin'
Oh, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A.
