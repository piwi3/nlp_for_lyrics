When your baby leaves you all alone 
And nobody calls you on the phone 
Don't ya feel like cryin'?
Don't ya feel like cryin', like cryin' like cryin'?
Come on baby, come on, cry to me 

When you're all alone in your lonely room 
And there's nothin' but the smell of her perfume 
Don't ya feel like cryin'?
Don't ya feel like cryin', like cryin' like cryin'?
Come on baby, come on, cry to me 

Nothin' could be sadder than a glass of wine alone 
Loneliness, loneliness, it's just a waste of your time 
But you don't ever, you don't ever have to walk alone 
You see, so come on take my hand 
Honey and walk with me 

When you're waitin' for a voice to come 
In the night and there's no one 
Don't ya feel like cryin'?
Don't ya feel like cryin', like cryin' like cryin'?
Come on baby, come on, cry to me 

Come on baby, I want you to cry to me
Yes, I want you to come on, little darlin'
Come on, come on and cry to me 
Yeah, come on baby, come on, come on and cry to me
Yeah, I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry (ooh)
Yeah I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry (ooh)
Ooh, come on, baby, come on, I want you to share those tears with me, yes I do
Yeah, come on little baby, come on, come on and cry to me, oh yes, oh yes
