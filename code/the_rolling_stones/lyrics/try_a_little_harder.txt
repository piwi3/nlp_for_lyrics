Do, do, do doot
Do doo n' do doot

Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder

Girl really wants you man
Don't you see you gotta give her
All the lovin' that she needs?
Gotta try, try it one more time
Gotta try, try it one more time

Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Give her lovin' that's a little stronger
Give her lovin' that's a little stronger

If you with your baby
When the day turns to night
You gotta give her lovin'
Make her feel all right
It's all right, it's all right
Try one more time, it's all right

Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Say goodnight and stay a little longer
Say goodnight and stay a little longer

You got to keep her from cryin' then you got to try
To work pretty hard to keep her satisfied
Just try, try it one more time
Try it one more time, gotta try

Try a little bit harder
Try a little bit harder
Try a little bit harder, baby
Try a little harder
Try a little harder

If you with your baby
When the day turns to night
You gotta give her lovin'
Make her feel all right
Gotta try
