Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

You know I'm a country boy
And I don't know what's going on

Don't say I don't love you
Because I will hold you on my arms

Don't say I don't love you
Because I won't hold you in my arms

By me being country boy
And I will always treat you right

Don't say I don't love you, girl
Because I won’t never treat you right

Don't say I don't love you, honey
Because I won’t never treat you right

You know I'm a country boy
I just love to stay out every night
