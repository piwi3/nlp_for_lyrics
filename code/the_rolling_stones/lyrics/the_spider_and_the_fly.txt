Sittin', drinkin', sinkin', drinkin' 
Wonderin' what I'd do when I'm through tonight 
Smokin', mopin', maybe just hopin' 
Some little girl will pass on by 
Don't wanna be alone but I love my girl at home 
I remember what she said (what she said)
She said, "my, my, my, don't tell lies, keep fidelity in your head 
My my my, don't tell lies, when you're done you should go to bed 
Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly 
Jump right ahead and you're dead" 

Sit up, fed up, low down, go round 
Down to the bar at the place I'm at 
Sittin', drinkin', superficially thinkin'
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left 
But then I said "hi" like a spider to a fly 
Rememberin' what my little girl said (haha)

She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty 
I would have run away but I was on my own 
She told me later she's a machine operator 
She said she liked the way I held the microphone 
Then I said "hi" like a spider to a fly 
Jump right ahead in my web
