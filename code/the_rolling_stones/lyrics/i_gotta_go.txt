Leavin' in the mornin' baby, I know I got to go
Leavin' in the mornin' you know I got to go
I've got the blues I can't stay here no more

I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun's goin' down
I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun's goin' down

I've got the blues I can't stay in your time

The moon is risin' and the sun is done goin' down
The moon is risin' and the sun is done goin' down

I've got the blues and I can't stay hangin' around

I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down

I've got the blues and my baby can't be found
