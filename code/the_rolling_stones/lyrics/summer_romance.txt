Just a few days and you'll be back in your school
I'll be sitting around by the swimming pool
And you'll be studying history and you'll be down the gym
And I'll be down the pub, probably playing pool and drinking

It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through
It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through

But just a few days and you'll be back in your class
Sucking up the teacher and you trying to get an a pass
You trying to hide your make-up and you're trying to flash your legs
Yeah, no sympathy from your spotty friends

It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through
It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through

I can't help myself
I can't help it if I'm older than you
I can't help myself
I can't help it if I'm older than you

I need money so much, I need money so bad
And I can't be your mum, I don't want to be your dad
I'm a serious man, I got serious lusts
I gonna have to do away with this greasy kid stuff

It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through
I can't help myself, I can't help it if I'm older than you
It's just a summer romance, a summer romance
And it's through
It's over now, it's a summer romance
And it's through

Summer romance
Summer romance
Summer romance
