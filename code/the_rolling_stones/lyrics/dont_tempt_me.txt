Don't tempt me baby
I got a good thing going at home
Too much to lose if I don't leave it alone
Don't tempt me baby

You got my heart locked out of your mind
I found the key but I have run out of time
I've tried to walk out of here walking the line
Don't tempt me baby

In the mirror behind the bar I could see
That come on over look that you gave to me
Truly flattering I guarantee
But I'm as spoken for as you must be free

Don't tempt me baby
I've got a ring around my finger you know
I should have headed home a long time ago
Don't tempt me baby

I made a promise it was well understand
What I couldn't do and what I could
I'm feeling weak and you're looking so good
Don't tempt me baby

Say now big boy don't you flatter yourself
That mirror must be showing you something else
You've been sitting here since two o'clock
And anyone can see you're stoned as a rock

Don't tempt me baby
You got a good thing going at home
Too much to lose if I don't leave it alone
Don't tempt me baby

You got my heart locked out of your mind
I found the key but I have run out of time
I've tried to walk out of here walking the line
Don't tempt me baby
