Oh baby, you don't have to go
Oh baby, you don't have to go
I beg you all night, baby, you don't have to go

Oh baby, what's gettin' wrong with you
Oh baby, what's gettin' wrong with you
You don't treat me nothin' like you used to do

Well, I gave you all of my money, let you go downtown
You come back in the evenin', call me all kind of clown
Oh baby, you don't have to go
You know I'm gonna pack up, baby, down the road I go

Oh baby, turn your lamp down low
Oh baby, turn your lamp down low
I beg you all night, baby, you don't have to go
