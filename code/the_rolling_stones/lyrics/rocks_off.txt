Oh yeah

I hear you talking
When I'm on the street
Your mouth don't move
But I can hear you speak

What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?

I'm always hearing voices
On the street
I want to shout
But I can't hardly speak

I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Come every time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days
At lightning speed
Plug in, flush out
And fire the fuckin' feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping

And I only get my rocks off
While I'm dreaming
And I only get my rocks off
While I'm sleeping

Only get them off
Only get them off
Get them off
Only get them off, get them off
Only get them off
