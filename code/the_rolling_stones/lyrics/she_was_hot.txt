New York was cold and damp
TV is just a blank
Looks like another dead end Sunday
What about an early night
Monday never feels so bright
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely
Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne
Grab a cab, grab a cab, and baby, come right by

But she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot, as i wiped her brow
She was hot, she pinned me to the ground
She was quick, she knew her way around
She was hot, and she tore my clothes
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky grey
Nothing like the good old days
I got a fever that I'm fighting
I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound just like lightning

And she was hot, in a 50's dress
She was hot, her lips were flashing red
I was hot, I was dripping sweat
She was hot, in the Detroit snow
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails
Always take your passion where you find it
Honey when you were young and fresh
And you need the touch of flesh
Go take the treasure where you find it

But she was hot, in the melted snow
She was hot, in the molten glow
She was hot, she got it in the blood
She was hot, like the dam that's burst

Down the avenue
Into the lost bayou
Into the tall bamboo
Into the human zoo
I wish you all the best
I hope we meet again
In a cold Chicago night

She was hot [x3]
She was hot, hot, hot... [x6]

She was hot, hot, hot... [x3]
In a cold Chicago night
