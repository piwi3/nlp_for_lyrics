Here you stand before me
Waiting to be kissed
You're a beauty, such a cutie
How could I resist?

It's been a month of Sundays
Since we last have spoke
So much water, you've got daughters
I fell out of the boat

Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad the first time
I can't stand it twice

Oh no, not you again
I can't stand the pace
Once bitten, twice shy
Let me out of the race

The setting's so romantic
Love is in the air
All is perfect but I'm allergic
To your piercing stares

You look so cool and tempting
In your couture dress
You're addictive, as predicted
I'm nervous, I confess

Oh no, not you again
Messing up my life
It was bad the first time, yeah
You had me in a vice

Oh no, not you again
I hear the inner shout
It was bad the first time around
When you turned me inside out

Everybody's talking
Showing off their wit
The moon is yellow but I'm not jello
Staring down your tits

My life flashes forward
Then it flashes back
I'm still dreaming and I'm screaming
"Get me off the rack!"

Oh no, not you again
I can't stand the pain
I was burned the first time, yeah
I can't deal again

Oh no, not you again
Messing up my life, yeah
Once bitten, twice shy
But I can't do it twice

Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad the first time around
I better take my own advice

Oh no
