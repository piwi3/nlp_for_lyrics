Time is on my side, yes it is.
Time is on my side, yes it is.
Now you all were saying that you want to be free
But you'll come runnin' back (I said you would baby), 
You'll come runnin' back (like I told you so many times before),
You'll come runnin' back to me.

Time is on my side, yes it is.
Time is on my side, yes it is.
You're searching for good times but just wait and see,
You'll come runnin' back (I said you would darling), 
You'll come runnin back (Spent the rest of life with ya baby),
You'll come runnin' back to me.

Go ahead baby, go ahead, go ahead and light up the town!
And baby, do anything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around.
And I know, I know like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back,
Yeah you're going to come back baby
Knockin', knockin' right on my door.

Time is on my side, yes it is.
Time is on my side, yes it is.
'Cause I got the real love, the kind that you need.
You'll come runnin' back (I knew you would one day), 
You'll come runnin' back (Baby I told you before),
You'll come runnin' back to me.

Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is.
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is. 
Time, time, time is on my side
