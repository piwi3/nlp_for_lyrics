Here I lie in my hospital bed 
Tell me, sister Morphine, when are you coming round again? 
Oh, I don't think I can wait that long 
Oh, you see that I'm not that strong 

The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears 
Tell me, sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here? 
What am I doing in this place? 
Why does the doctor have no face? 

Oh, I can't crawl across the floor 
Ah, can't you see, Sister Morphine, I'm trying to score 

Well it just goes to show 
Things are not what they seem 
Please, sister Morphine, turn my nightmares into dreams 
Oh, can't you see I'm fading fast? 
And that this shot will be my last 

Sweet cousin Cocaine, lay your cool cool hand on my head 
Ah, come on, sister Morphine, you better make up my bed 
'Cause you know and I know in the morning I'll be dead 
Yeah, and you can sit around, yeah and you can watch all 
The clean white sheets stained red
