My spirit is winging 
My soul is free 
I'm doing my drinking 
In good company 
The music's screaming 
My feet are flying 
And everybody's laughing 
And nobody's crying 
A sneak suspicion 
It drags me down 
A nagging feeling 
Going round 

A heart for sale 
A going cheap 
A heart for sale 
Lovers' leap 

My belly's full 
My glass is brimming 
The women look so beautiful 
And I feel like singing 
The voice of conscience 
The voice of reason 
Yacking in my plans, boy
I call that treason 

A heart for sale 
They're going cheap 
A heart for sale 
Blood runs deep

I'm losing my willpower 
My blood's running cold 
My body's on pause and
My mind's stuck on hold 
And not much I can do about it

A sneak suspicion 
It drags me down 
A nagging feeling 
I'm going round 

Heart for sale 
They're going cheap 
A heart for sale 
Blood runs deep
Heart for sale 

I don't need no doctor (Heart for sale)
I need a deputation 
I tell you, if you don't want my loving 
You can just take my resignation (Heart for sale)
(Heart for sale)
(Heart for sale)
(Heart for sale)
It's under a hammer 
I'm a full time worker, baby
I'm a real body slammer
