Hannah baby was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel and her nose were slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the memory motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took one starry night to steal my heart away
Out on the water front, her hair all drenched in spray

Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel and her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar, she began to play
She sang a song for me and it stuck right in my heart

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yes she does
She got a mind of her own
And she use it, she used it mighty fine, yeah

She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin, she turned a mile or two
When I asked her where she's headed for
"Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"

And you're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind, she got a mind of her own
And she used it mighty fine, yes she does, oh yeah
She got a mind of her own
And she used it well

On the seventh day, my eyes were all a glaze
We've been ten thousand miles, I've been to fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried

What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor?
It's just some friends of mine and they're busting down the door
Been a lonely night at the memory motel
Oh yes it is

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me, oh yeah

She got a mind of her own
And she used it well, yes she does, oh yeah
She got a mind of her own
And she used it mighty fine
