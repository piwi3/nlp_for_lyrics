Out in the darkest place|With this a thousand shades of blue|Everyone looks the same|And then your light came into view||[Pre-Chorus:]|You stop my heart and got me sayin'|Where did you come from?|It's like you fell above of the sky to save me|An angel from the sun||[Chorus:]|I could live forever|In your arms, in your arms|Baby, we can fly together|To the stars, back to Mars|Everywhere you go|My future it's with you from tonight|I could live forever|In your arms, in your arms||And when I touch your face|It's shows me worlds I never known|Frozen in time and space|Don't want to let this moment go||[Pre-Chorus]||[Chorus]||Stay with me, come stay with me forever, and ever|Takin' me, you're taking me to heaven, to heaven||I could live forever, in your arms, in your arms|Baby, we could fly together, to the stars, back to Mars||[Chorus]|
