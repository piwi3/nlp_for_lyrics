Hm, yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hole me now, don't bother if every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become

[Chorus]
Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful loneliness is tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus]

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on the things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus: x2]

Show you the shape of my heart
