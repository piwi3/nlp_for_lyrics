I’ve seen it all a thousand times
Falling down I'm still alive, am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water’s high
No need to swim I'll learn to fly, so high, so high
You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

Gloves are off, ready to fight
Like a lion I will survive.
Will I? Will I?
You gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone, don’t be afraid
It’s gonna be alright

You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky (woo, woo, woo)
Living proof I see myself in you, (oh)

When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh,
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of)

You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of!)
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
(For you, for you!)
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
(You can show ‘em what you’re made of)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh,
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of) ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
