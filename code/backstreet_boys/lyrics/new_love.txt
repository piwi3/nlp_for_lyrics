Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Who are you, the sex police?
My sex ain't got no rules
Got a million options next to me, yeah
Let me do what I do

And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
Ne-e-e-ew love

Don't say it's the wrong thing
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (oh yeah)
I stay on my own thing
Then I be in a long thing

And I call it new love
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

I won't not love you all over me
In any dark room
And I don't wanna know your name
Just let me do what I do, ooh yeah, baby

And I call it new love, new love, new love (new love, new love, new love)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (new love, new love, new love)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (new love, new love, new love)
Ne-e-e-ew love

Don't say it's the wrong thing (don't say it's the wrong thing)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (don't feel like the wrong thing)
I stay on my own thing
Then I be in a long thing

Yeah, it's only love, it ain't no pressure
No expectations, only healing now
Baby, we're in this thing together
You and I don't feel like the wrong thing, yeah (oh yeah)

Don't say it's the wrong thing (oh, oh, oh yeah)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
I stay on my own thing (oh, oh, oh yeah)
Then I be in a long thing (and I be in a long thing) (oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)

And I call it new love, new love, new love (oh, oh, oh yeah)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (oh, oh, oh yeah)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
