I saw you on the corner
You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was then?
When you walked out of my house
I didn't say a thing, no
It's funny how a year can fill you head with should've, would've, could've been

Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day without you, come on

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Whoa, whoa, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back
Whoa, whoa, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back

Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Whoa, whoa, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back
Whoa, whoa, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back
Baby, would you meet me at the chateau?
Baby, I want you back
Oh, baby, would you meet me at the chateau?
Baby, I want you back
