Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside

And girl you leave me breathless
But it's ok
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough

'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety
Of falling free into your arms

I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
It's only you can save me
Oh, can't you see?

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough
(It don't seem like long enough, yeah)

'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Go on pull me under
Cover me with dreams
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air that I breathe!

'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
(Every time I breathe, yeah)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
(Baby I can't help it)

You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Baby drowning
(OhÃ¢?Â¦)
Got me drowning
Keep me drowning in your love

Baby I can't help it
(Can't help it, can't help it no no)
Got me drowning

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough

'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
(I do)
And my heart beats again
(Oh yeah)

Baby I can't help it
(Baby I can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above

(Got me drowning)
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
