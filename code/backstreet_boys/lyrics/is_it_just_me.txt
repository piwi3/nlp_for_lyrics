Used to heatin' up in the shower, out of her arms
Now you're always in a rush
I could be paranoid but I swear, it's up in the air
Are you fallin' out of love?
The more I think about what we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure, it wasn't what it was, yeah
We used to be, used to be better (used to be better)

We used to talk about growin' old, now I don't know
If we gon' make it through the month
Don't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop
I'm over overthinking us
Feelin' like it's nowhere to go, it's taking a toll
I don't wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better

Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me?
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
Is it just, just me? Ooh

It's two AM, you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin' but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know what's going on, 'cause
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure, I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better

Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me?
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me?
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
Is it just, just me? Ooh

Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Never forget, back when we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me? (Just me, baby)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me? (Just me, baby)
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? Ooh
(Is it just me?)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(I been standin', waitin', gazin' up)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(You know, you know, you know, I love you)
Is it just, just me? Ooh
(I been waiting for you, baby, yeah, tonight)

Is it just me, is it, is it?
Is it just me, is it, is it?
