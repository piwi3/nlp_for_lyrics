Frost grows outside the window
First kiss under the mistletoe
Oh oh, oh oh
Bells chime inside a steeple
Open the doors see the people sing
Oh oh, oh oh

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again

La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!

I've been checking my list twice
Got plans to give you your gift tonight
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Wake up under a lit tree
One wish came true you're here with me
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Yeah

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town

That's when it's Christmas time again

La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa's back in town, town, town
That's when it's Christmas time again
Again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
I give you, I give you my heart
Yeah, it's Christmas

Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!

I've been back
I've been good
I've been everything I should

Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!
Ta ta ta ta, it's Christmas time again!

I've been back
I've been good
And you know that I do what I should!

La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
La da la da da da da, la da la da la la, it's Christmas time again!
