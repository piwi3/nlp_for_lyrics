I been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

I've been losin days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I-I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

Oh no
I thought you were the only one girl
But now I think I was wrong
Cause life goes on
Na na na na na

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I,

I-I wanna feel the rain again
I-I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away 
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na
Feel the rain
Na na na na

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain

I wanna feel the rain
