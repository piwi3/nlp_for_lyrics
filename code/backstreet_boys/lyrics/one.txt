I'll be the one

I guess you were lost when I met you
But still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run

I'll be the one to hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
Helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run

I'll be the one to hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams coming true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, baby, please

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it all right
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run

I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's no where to run
I'll be the one

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it all right
I'll be the light
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it all right

I'll be the one to hold you
And make sure that you'll be all right

I'll be the one
