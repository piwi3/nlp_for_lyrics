You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

So many times I've been alone
I didn't know what to do
I don't know where I'd be
If I didn't have, I didn't have you
You comfort me
Make me believe
Give me the strength I need
Since you came into my life it's been so heavenly
Heavenly

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

So many things I want to say to you
I'd give my all to you just because
You came around and gave me
All your, all your love
Now I'd sacrifice my very life
All you have to do is say the word
And there would never be no other

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
You're the reason
Ooh ooh
And you
You're the reason why I have a sing
Ooh you're my everything
