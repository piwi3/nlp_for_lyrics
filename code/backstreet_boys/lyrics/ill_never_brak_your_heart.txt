Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel you could never love again
But all I'm asking is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day, that I saw your smiling face
Honey I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said no but I found out
Darlin that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove that's all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die
Than live without you
I'll give you all of me honey thats no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die
Than live without you
I'll give you all of me honey thats no lie

As time rolls by you will get to know me
A little more better, girl thats the way love goes
And I know you're afraid to let your feelings show
And I understand but girl it's time to let go

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove that's all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die
Than live without you
I'll give you all of me honey thats no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die
Than live without you
I'll give you all of me honey thats no lie

I'll never break your heart
No way (no way)
Girl I'll never make you cry (make you cry)
I swear (I swear, honey I swear)
I'll never break your heart
(I would never do that to you baby)
Oh just give me a chance I'll show you how much I love you
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me (I would give you the world, if you're mine girl)
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me honey that's no lie
(Oh I miss you I want you I need you in my life)
(He could never do the things that I can do for you)
