Scrolling through all your vacation pictures
Feelin' sorry for myself, 'cause I'm not in them
I talk about how much I miss ya
And if I could press rewind, I'd listen
Over and over and over again

I wish I had figured it out 'cause
My days are nothing without us
Wish I had known what I had, 'cause now

On my best days
His day is better 'cause he's with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

I didn't really know what I was doing
Wish that I could have finished what I started
What I started, alright
I was immature and stupid
Now I'm just immature and brokenhearted
Over and over and over again

I wish I had figured it out 'cause
My days are nothing without us
Wish I had known what I had, 'cause now

On my best days
His day is better 'cause he's with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

You left me, trying to live it on out
'Cause you took our dreams and you're livin' 'em out
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days
So much to be sorry about
I wish I knew, I was wanting enough
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days

And if I had a second chance
I would take you right back right now
I would take you right back right now, hey
And if I had a second chance
I would take you right back right now
I would take you right back

On my best days
His day is better 'cause he's with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

You left me, trying to live it on out
'Cause you took our dreams and you're livin' 'em out
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days
So much to be sorry about
I wish I knew, I was wanting enough
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days
