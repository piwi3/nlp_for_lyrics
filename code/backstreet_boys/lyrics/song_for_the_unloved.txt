This one's for the mothers who have lost a child
This one's for the gypsies who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers sleepin' in my heart
They take what they want and leave while it's still dark

No one is glamorously lonely, all by themselves

This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved

This one's for the bridesmaid, never the bride
And this one's for the dreamer who locked his faith inside
And this is for the widows who think there's only one
For the dying fathers who never told their sons

No one is glamorously lonely, follow your heart

This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved

Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive

For one last cry, for one last cry

This is a song for the unloved
And this is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind

This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind

This is, this is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved
