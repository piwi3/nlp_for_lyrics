Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you

There is nobody who can make me cry
Nobody can do
Nobody but you
Nobody but you

Ain't nobody else but you
There is nobody who can make me lie
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you
Nobody but you

Ain't nobody else but you
Nobody, nobody but you
Gimme one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite

Baby, it's true
Ain't nobody else but you
There's no one like you

There is nobody who can make it right
Nobody else can do
Nobody but you
You know what to do

Nobody else but you
Nobody, nobody but you
Somebody tell me
'Cuz I can't eat or sleep

When you're not close to my body
You're a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night

Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Nobody but you
Ain't nobody else but you

Nobody but you
Gimme one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
'Cuz baby it's true

Ain't nobody else but you
