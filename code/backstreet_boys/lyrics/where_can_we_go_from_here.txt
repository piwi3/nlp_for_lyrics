I try to pick the pieces up
I can't think of starting over
We used to share the stars above
I don't wanna think of change
But now I've gotta move on
I've gotta catch up to the world
Even though I gave you my life
As wrong, as its seems, I know its right
But is there a place that I can go away
To escape the love that I will forever know?

CHORUS
Where can we go from here?
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
Where can we go from here?

Why? Why do I cry inside
For a love that's gone away?
How? How can I carry on
When I know all the love is gone?
Tell me where can I go to get away
From the pain of loving you?

Tell me where

CHORUS- REPEAT
