It's another night, another day
It's another street with another name
Just another storm, just another rain
But now nothing feels the same

Yesterday I thought this was solid ground
Just another thing I was wrong about
But I never learned till I crashed and burned
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should've left love alone
Maybe I should've listen when they said
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home

Guess what
Now I can live without all the foolish love 
Better by myself with no one around
That's what I'm saying now
But that's such a lie
'Cause I know that once I look in her eyes
I fall back in love
Guess I'll never learn till it crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should've left love alone
I was gonna, I was gonna
Maybe I should've listen when they said
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home

Said I was playing with fire 
When I should have left love alone 
Maybe I should have listen when they said 
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home

Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself that I wouldn't fall
But look at me now, so lost
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way, because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
But I can't keep on

Said I was playing with fire 
When I should have left love alone 
(Should have left love alone)
Maybe I should have listen when they said 
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
Playing with fire
