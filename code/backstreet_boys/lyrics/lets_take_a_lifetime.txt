Say no more if you want to kiss goodnight
That's alright by me
Close your door, make sure the latch is tight
Fall gently to sleep

We don't have to rush ahead
Putting questions in your head
And an ache in your heart

Let's take a lifetime, all that we desire
Build it day by day into forever
Let's take a lifetime, all that you require
Here and now and ever

In these times love is not some harmless game
It's played strictly for keeps
No, and it's no crime wanting me to feel the same
With water so deep

Come tomorrow once again
We'll be together until then
We have dreaming to do

Let's take a lifetime, all that we desire
Build it day by day into forever
Let's take a lifetime, all that you require
Here and now and lasting evermore

So hard to leave you standing there in the light
You look so lovely, if we must wait
No use tempting fate

Let's take a lifetime, all that we desire
Build it day by day into forever
Let's take a lifetime, all that you require
Let's not hurry through the night

When our love could last a lifetime, all that we desire
Build it day by day into forever
Let's take a lifetime, all that you require
Let's not hurry through the night

When our love could last a lifetime, all that we desire
