Hey, yeah
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
That's the way I like it
(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind? (That's the way I like it)
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

Oh, mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
'Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it

(That's the way I like it, baby, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on

You gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way you do it
Hey, yeah!

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it (everybody come on)
That's the way I like it

That's the way that I like it (everybody now)
That is the way I like it (everybody now)
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way that I like it (everybody come on)
That is the way I like it

(That's the way that, that's the way I)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way)
