Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same
Still numb from you
First step off of this plane, I knew
I suffocate without you
Heart beats for two

You was good (Was good)
What we had (What we had)
Yeah, that was better times
Can somebody take me back? (Take me back)
And it hurts (It hurts)
Looking back (Looking back)
If this is for the best
Tell me why it hurts so bad (So bad)

Don't let go when the daylight's gone
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, breathe, oh
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, breathe, breathe, oh

Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

Regrets dancing around my head
Everything I never said
Still numb from you (From you, from you, from you)
Secrets sleeping all over this bed (Over this bed)
Memories of what we did (What we did)
Got mixed with you, oh-woah

And it hurts (It hurts)
Looking back (Looking back)
If this is for the best
Tell me why it hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)

Don't let go when the daylight's gone (Light's gone)
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, breathe, breathe (Oh, I breathe)
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs (My lungs)
I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, breathe, breathe (Oh, I breathe)

Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe (Oh, I breathe)
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe

Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same
Still numb from you
