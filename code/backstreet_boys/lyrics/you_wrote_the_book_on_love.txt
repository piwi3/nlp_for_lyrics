When I first met you my life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I'd missed

You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl when you touch me
I began to understand (Ohhh)

CHORUS
You, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love

(Oh Brian help me sing)

Each time I hold you
I find something new
'Cause I know what I love about you baby
Girl I discovered
You bring out the lover in me (yeah, yeah)
Your like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
'Cause everytime I look at you I feel
Love I can't explain (ohhh)

CHORUS

I hear what your heart is saying to me
I see the picture so clearly
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings, baby
When you're near me

You wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book

Oh you, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word
'Cause you, babe you wrote the book

CHORUS

You wrote the book on love
You wrote the book on love
