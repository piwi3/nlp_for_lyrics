To be happy
You are all I need
To make me happy
Because every time you're near
All the tears inside are raindrops
All the sadness in my lifetime goes away
Just believe in me
All I need is someone
Who believes in me
You're the good luck charm
You're the reason for the rainbows
God knows I'd hate to see you go away
Baby don't leave me this way

If you stay
If you stay, I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you, I'm the only one for you baby
If you stay
If you stay with me
I'll show you
I'll show you how much I need you
Oh how much I need you

To be with you
I just wanna constantly be with you
It's only when you're around
All the problems solve my problems
All the clouds inside my garden roll away
Baby they roll away

If you stay
If you stay, I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you, I'm the only one for you baby
If you stay
If you stay with me
I'll show you
I'll show you how much I need you
Oh how much I need you

Oh forever
You have all my gratitude forever
For being who you are
Brings me victory as a promise
My frustrations and my losses fly high away
They fly

If you stay
If you stay, I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you, I'm the only one for you baby
If you stay
If you stay with me
I'll show you
I'll show you how much I need you
Oh how much I need you

Only if you stay, only if you stay 
Only if you stay, only if you stay
