do, da da da da
do, da da da da
do, da da da da

The candle plays the hourglass
Days go and all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile even all the reasons why
You say I pushed you out of my life

Chorus
Baby you set me (ha-ha-ahhh)
Baby you set me (do da da da da)
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you set me 
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with 
The biggest empty void 
I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
Bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there 
when the mornin comes
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life)
Baby will you be there
When I open my eyes
After all the time I've spent 
Wishing you

Chorus

Sadness has overwhelmed me
my mind flies carelessly 
I Imagine that you're happy 
With your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things
That I could never have

Chorus to fade
