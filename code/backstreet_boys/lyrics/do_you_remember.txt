Do you remember how I showed up at your door?
Middle of the night, begging you for more

I wanna go from hidin' to dancing in the rain
When I saw you smilin', it healed me from my pain

Oh, you must be an angel, right from the sky
Or are you some kind of sinner? 'Cause somethin' this good can't be right

So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget

Want us to forget

Do you remember when
I could never find the words to explain?
And we got enough of each other, so I guess
Some things never change

Oh, you must be an angel, right from the sky
'Cause you still got that somethin' in your eyes
Every look, every smile just gives me life

So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget

Want us to forget
