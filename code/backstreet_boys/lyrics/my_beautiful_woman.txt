No no baby 
How can I begin to tell you 
What you do to me every time I hear ya 
More willing to want to see ya 
I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain the confusion 
But still I'm not complainin' 
'Bout my situation 
Let's not talk about a possible ending 

The very first time that I 
was lookin' to be your fella 
I found my inspiration 
hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself on forward 
for your consideration 

[Chorus]
Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day 
And I know I'm so in love with you 
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe 
Every time I'm near a beautiful woman 

And so we put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around 
It's too late to stop me 
I know we're gonna get down, get down, oh no 

[Chorus] 

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
Anything that you want me to, I'll do 
My beautiful

be	 is for beautiful as the sunshine 
E tells me everything's feelin' alright 
A goes to you and me swingin' it down 
T is two, I want you 
You've got me actin' like a fool 

[Chorus: x2]

My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman 
Yes you are, yes you are 
My beautiful woman 
You're so beautiful 
My beautiful woman 
My beautiful woman
