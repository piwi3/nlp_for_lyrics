July
It's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew, from that night
That I would be alright

If I
I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Baby, I'm all in it
Just tell me you were on in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning

Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh

We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
Ooh, eh, eh

We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm ok
Nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok
