I let the heat, let the moment
Let it take control of me
A couple drinks had me zonin'
Might have said a couple things

That I didn't mean to say, I probably should explain
So you don't think it's just the liquor talking
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real
I hope you don't get mad when I say I

Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

You got me bad in the worst way
And it never felt so good (never felt so good)
I'm so attached, I'm beggin' mercy
I wouldn't stop it if I could

I don't wanna change, I probably should explain
So, you don't think it's just the liquor talking?
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real
I hope you don't get mad when I say I

Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

Said I love you but I
Said I love you but I
But I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more
(You are so much more) You're so much more than that
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more (You)
You're so much, you're so much more (So much)
You're so much more than that (oh, no)

Said I love you but I
But I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

You're so much, you're so much more
(You're so much, you're so much more)
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much more than that
You're so much, you're so much more
(You're so much, you're so much more)
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much more than that
