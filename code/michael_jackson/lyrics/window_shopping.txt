[Chorus]
I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try
You saw me, control me
I was window shopping, window shopping
Never meant to buy
Just touch and try

I thought I had my game up tight
But with you I couldn't play ti right
I pretended to be ice cold
But inside my temperature rose, oh yeah

[Repeat: x11]
Hoo

I tried and I tried but I can't resist

[Chorus]

To think that I once boasted around
No ones arms could ever tie me down
But you've changed my point of view
And now I'm trying to tie a knot onto you, oh baby

[Repeat: x11]
Hoo

I was selling to the buyer until I met you

[Chorus]

You're priceless merchandise
Precious merchandise
You saw me, control me

[Chorus]
