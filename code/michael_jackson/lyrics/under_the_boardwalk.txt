Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tar on the roof
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-proof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walkin' above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the palms you hear the happy sounds of the carousel
And you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walkin' above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the palms you hear the happy sounds of the carousel
And you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be
