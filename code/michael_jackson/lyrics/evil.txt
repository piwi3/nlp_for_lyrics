Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts, evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide

Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred
Evil, why have you stolen so much love
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free

Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes, evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world evil
Evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes
Leaving sweet love alone and outcast of the world
