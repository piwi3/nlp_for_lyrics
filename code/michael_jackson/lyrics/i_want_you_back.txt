Uh ohh
Let me tell you now
Uh huh

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back) yes, I do now
(I want you back) ooh ooh, baby
(I want you back) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back) Now, now, now, now

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
(Let me show you now)

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms 
(Ohh) (bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum 
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I want
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I need
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I want
(Bum, bum, bum, bum-buh-bum, bum) ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show that I love you
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)

(I want you back)
Forget what happened then (I want you back)
Let me live again

Oh, baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you it is all
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cause
Get back what I lost

Oh baby I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
Baby (Oh), baby (oh), baby (oh)
I want you back, ha
I want you back
