Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You persuaded me to love you,
And I did, 
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead,
Into your arms I fell, 
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there.
Spoken:  You closed the door of your heart and turned the key,
locked your love away from me.
 
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You made me love you, 
And oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You said loving you would make life beautiful 
with each passing day,
But as soon as love came into my heart, 
you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
