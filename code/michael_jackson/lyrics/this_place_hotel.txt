Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can`t convince this girl there ain`t no other 
 
Someone`s evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile`s trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He`s been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel
