Ah I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feel sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feels sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart feels sad

Oh, black cruel signing up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And if the world baby nothing's right
Since you've been gone baby
Can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart feel sad, love's gone bad

Ow

Aw, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Aw! ow

Oh, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Aw!
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Come on!
