Baby, you got honey love
Sweeter than candy, you got honey love
I've got to have it, that honey love
Sweeter than candy, that got honey love

I keep on yearning all in my sleep
You've got me burning for that sweet treat

Baby, you got honey love
Sweeter than candy, you got honey love
Keep on making that honey love
Keep on shaking that honey love
Keep on making that honey love
I'll keep taking that honey love

I can't believe love can be so neat
Oh and your sweet love, girl it just can't be beat

Baby, you got honey love
It's sweeter than candy, that honey love

Honey love, honey love, honey love, honey love

Baby, adowop, adoo adoo adoowop
Baby, adowop, adoo adoo adoowop

Let's get down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Oh baby, girl you got me screaming

Honey, oh honey

Baby, baby
