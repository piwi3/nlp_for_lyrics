Can I see you (can I see you)
In the morning (in the morning)

Can I see you (can I see you)
In the morning (in the morning)

Can I see you in the morning
Like I see you late tonight
Come and hold me
Come and hold me

Come and make me feel alright
In the morning
Can I see you in the morning

Can I see you in the morning
Once I get down on my knees
Come and take me
Come and take me
Do with me just what you please
Just a short walk in the sunshine
In the open side by side

Chance to hold you
Chance to hold you
Chance to hold my head up high
In the morning

They say you're too old for me
He says "You're too old for me."
But I know ya said that y'all wait for me, wait for me

Can I see you in the morning sun
Shining down

I wanna see you
I wanna see you

Can I see you in the morning sun
Shining down

Can I see you
Can I see you

In the morning
Can I see you
In the morning
In the morning
Can I see you
In the morning
Can I see you
In the morning
