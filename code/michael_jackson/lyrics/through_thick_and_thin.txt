(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

Today did I forget
To say "I love you", girl (I'm sorry)
Hey, don't scold me yet
I'll prove it a hundred ways (Don't worry)

In this world of ups and downs
Baby, you're the one, the thing I found
You saved me from a place we both had been
Called lonely (Lonely)

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

When things aren't going right
I'll hold you in my arms (Don't worry)
You know you make me cry
If ever I let you down (I'm sorry)

Well I'm going to prove my love to you
Each day that I live my life with you
Through good and bad weather
We're together (Together)

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

Ooh, baby (Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, yeah, yeah
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, yeah
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you

(Through thick and thin)
I will always love you, ooh baby
(Through thick and thin)
I'm always thinking of you
