Close my eyes and I see your face at night
Toss and turn, fall to sleep holding my pillow tight
All the time I think of you
You're with me no matter what I do

Walk around with a smile upon my face
In my mind you have taken up permanent space
I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

S E R I O U S, baby
Let's get serious
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In your arms is the place I want to be
With my love in you and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much love we want to share

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

And fall in love
