Mother earth told the people
That the cold nights can be warm
Just get along with your brother
(it's the shelter from the storm)

If you're standing in the sunshine
But still out in the rain
Let your heart strike a match
(cause love lights the flame)

[Chorus]
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let it burn forever and ever
Let love bring us together
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let us join our hands together
Make a chain that bonds forever

Motionless people gather dust
Stand in the rain and you'll rust

Let's try to show compassion
It's the time for us to learn
There will be a better tomorrow
Our reward is love in return

[Chorus]
