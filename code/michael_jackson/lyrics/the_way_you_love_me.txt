I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Oh ooh 
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Oh ooh 

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
Ooh ooh 

I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me

The world's a better place

'Cause you came in time,

You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
