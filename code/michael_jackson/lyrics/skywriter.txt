Skywriter
Sweep your silver pen,
Across the sky
So high

Skywriter
Won't you write the biggest
I love you
Cross the sky

She don't read the letter
I write anymore
Sorry I upset her 
But I wasn't sure

Now I know I love her
I hope that she will see
A message high above her
That you write for me, yeah.

Skywriter,
Won't you write the biggest
I love you
Cross the sky

Hey
Hey,
Send a box of candy
And flowers ev'ry day
Still she wouldn't listen
Her pride got in the way

Now it's up to you
It won't fade away
Write it on the heavens
Love will make it stay, yeah

Won't you write the biggest
I love you
Cross the sky
So high, so high,
So high, so high,
So high, so high.
