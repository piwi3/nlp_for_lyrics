Lately, there seems to be 
Some insecurities 
About the way I feel 
Where I want to be 

Boy, you know it's with you 
No one can do 
The things you do to me 
Never to be mistaken 

Long as it's love we're making 
There'll be no hesitating, you and me. 
That's the way it will be 
And I won't leave your side 
You should know... 

[Chorus:]
Love will be right here, be right here 
Right here, be right here 
(Don't you have no) No fear, have no fear 
(Don't shed) no tears, love is here 

True love some don't believe in 
That's just what I'm giving 
I'm gonna keep it strong 
I'll be holding on to you. 

No on can do me like you do, it's true 
Sure as the sun is shining 
Our love will keep on climbing 
There's gonna be some rain, gonna be some pain 

But as long as I know 
Boy, time will show 
Our love will grow, and I know... 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Won't let go. You should know this thing is real 
No questions, just listen to you heart and 
Love will be right... 

[Rap-Taj] 
Baby, what's the problem 
It's seems like we're having trouble 
You don't seem to understand 
The life I lead ain't double 

My heart belongs to you, and only you 
And you know it's true 
A phony imitation just won't do 
Relax your mind 

I'm not the kind who runs around 
And wastes time, other fine brothers just don't compare 
I'll be there, I swear, far or near, have no fear 
I don't care, you can count on me, I'm right here 

[Repeat Chorus]
