Where did you come from lady 
And ooh won't you take me there 
Right away won't you baby 
Tendoroni you've got to be 
Spark my nature 
Sugar fly with me 
Don't you know now 
Is the perfect time 
We can make it right 
Hit the city lights 
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain 
Let me take you to the max 

[Chorus]
I want to love you (P-Y-T) 
Pretty young thing 
You need some lovin' (T-L-C) 
Tender lovin' care 
And I'll take you there 
I want to love you (P-Y-T) 
Pretty young thing 
You need some lovin' (T-L-C)
Tender lovin' care 
And I'll take you there 

(Anywhere you want to go)

Nothin' can stop this burnin' 
Desire to be with you 
Gotta get to you baby 
Won't you come, it's emergency 
Cool my fire yearnin' 
Honey, come set me free 
Don't you know now is the perfect time 
We can dim the lights 
Just to make it right 
In the night 
Hit the lovin' spot 
I'll give you all that I've got 

[Chorus]
 
Pretty young things, repeat after me 
I said,
Na na na 
Na na na na
Na na na na 
Na na na 
Na na na 
I said na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
I'll take you there 

[Chorus]
