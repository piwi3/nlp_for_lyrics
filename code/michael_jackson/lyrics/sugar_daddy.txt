Doo doo ba doo doo doo doo
Doo doo ba doo doo doo doo
Doo doo ba doo doo doo doo
Doo doo ba doo doo doo doo

Ooh, brand new boots I bought ya,
Fine, fine, blew your mind
Finally thought I caught ya
And your love was mine all mine

I see you walk by with other guys,
Step, step, steppin' on my toes
The whole world's talkin' 'bout
How I'm your stand by Santa Claus

But ooh, your kisses thrill me,
Sure love your angel eyes
The devil in you kills me,
But I made up my mind

I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby I'll be your sugar daddy,
Give you kissin' when it's missin', yeah
Oh baby, I'll try to keep you happy
'Cause I got a sweet tooth for your love

S-U-G, listen to me, listen to me
A-R, what it is, what it is
D-A-D-D-Y spells I'm your good thing

King of fools they crowned me
And that crown just fits me to a "T"
'Cause you only come around me
Just to pick up what you need

You just play on my emotions,
With please, please, pretty please
Well everybody's go the notion
I'm your goodwill industry (Oh Henry)

He's driving me nuts,
While I'm giving you the candy,
He's gettin' all your love
(Mary Jane said)
Mary Jane said I'm just your lollipop, sucker
Well my flavor's long lasting girl,
It ain't never gonna stop, no

Baby I'm a fool
Just a fool in love with you (I can't help myself, oh no)
Oh no I can't help myself

I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby I'll be your sugar daddy,
Give you kissin' when it's missin'
I'll even let you drive my caddy,
When I get one baby
Oh oh oh I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey, all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
