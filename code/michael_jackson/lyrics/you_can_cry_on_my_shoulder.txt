Just because you know, I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Because you lost his love

Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna see you in misery
So come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do I'll understand
Maybe, I can show you
How you can win his love again

It may seem strange, I know
But it's just that I love you
So come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

Girl, you've given him all you had
He'd better stop treating you so bad
Come on, babe, come on, oh
(Come on, come on, come on)

You can cry on my shoulder
Yes, you can, girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me yeah babe

Yes, you can now
Ooh, ooh yes
Yes, you can, girl
I'll be there to help

You can cry, you can cry
You can cry, baby
(You can cry on my shoulder)
Ooh yeah, babe, yeah babe
(You can cry on my shoulder)
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
