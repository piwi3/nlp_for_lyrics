When we were tiny little boys
We use to dance, we use to sing
Before we even learned to crawl or walk
As we grew up we didn't change
I guess we knew right from the start
We'd loved the spotlight and the stage
Cause we were born to entertain
And when we walk out on the stage
The way we feel deep inside
Is something magic when the music starts to play
We want to bring a little happiness and love into your lives
Forget about your problems and your troubles for a little while
We're here to entertain you 
On stage right now
We're here to entertain you 
Right here, right now
We like to dance, we like to sing
And do our thing
We like to dance, we like to sing
We like to do our thing
There's no business
Like show business
There's no business
Like show business
We're here to entertain you 
On stage right now
We're here to entertain you
Right here, right now
On stage right now
Right here, right now
On stage right now
