You're good
You're so good

Every now and then I think about
What my life would be without you
You're good for me

I think of all the lonely days
The lonely nights I went without
You're good for me

If I had to do it (if I had to do it)
All over again (all over)
I'll have no life without ya
That's the way I feel about you

Every night I reach to touch
To know you're there is just enough
You're good for me (you're good for me)

It's easy now for me to say
But things could have turned out a different way
You're good for me

If I had to do it (if I had to do it)
All over again (all over)
I'll have no life without ya
That's the way I feel about you
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, don't ya
(don't ya know) don't ya know
You're good for me (you're good for me)
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, don't ya
(don't ya know) don't ya know
You're good for me (you're good for me)
