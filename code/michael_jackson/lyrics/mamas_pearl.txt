You send cold chills
Up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills
Then you draw the line
Oh baby
(Oh baby)

'Cause your mama told you
That love ain't right
But don't you know
Good lovin' is the spice of life? Yeah
Mama's pearls, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin' 
(What you been missin')

Ooh, ooh, now baby
Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me whissin

(Keep me whissin')

You want my lovin' yes you do, do, do
(Yes you do, you know you do)
You know my lovin' is true, true, true
Now baby
(Oh baby)

But your conscience tells you
That love is wrong,
(Ooh)
But just a little lovin' never hurt no one, oh
Mama's pearls, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'

Let all it hang
