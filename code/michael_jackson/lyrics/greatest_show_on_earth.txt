Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like ferris wheels and spinning carousels

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Oh, everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth

The fantasy you see is like a child again
Through rainbow colored eyes
Step right up its circus time
And get your moneys worth of love today

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth

Everyday is a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth

Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth, yeah
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth
