I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight
You are the spring, ours life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever
I am the one who came when you feel down

I was the only one around, (the only one)
When things were hurting you
I am forever

Wasn't it I who someday you are free
Wonder if it seems so hard to be,
And things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever
I am your friend, through thick and thin
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart

We never say I don't need you,
We are forever

I am the one who someday you are free
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, (the only one)
And nothing would cheer you

I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun that lights summer sky,
When things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back,
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you

We are forever, I am forever,
We are forever, I am forever

We are forever (what ya doing to me boy)
We are forever
(what ya doing to me boy, I believe its strong)
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, I am forever, alright
We are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am forever.
