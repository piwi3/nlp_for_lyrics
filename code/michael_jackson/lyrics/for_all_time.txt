Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, the songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell,
When two hearts belong so well

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love undeceiving
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
And sun may refuse to shine
Oh no..
When I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
(Oh, let our love meet quite days)
(Let souls embrace)
(So silently)
(Oh...don't let have me charade)
All these words got young lovers say...

Maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say, I need you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
Don't ever don't lie
That's for all time
We can make loving
That's for all time
Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you will never go
That's for all time...
