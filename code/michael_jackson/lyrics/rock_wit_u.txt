Aw, baby
(Yeah, Murder Inc.)
I want to love you, babe
I want to love you, babe
Oh, baby
(Ashanti, Chapter 2)
(Let's rock it)

[Chorus]
Can you rock with me (Aw, baby)
Non-stop with me
Can you take it to the top with me
I just want to love you, baby (Love ya, babe)
Always thinkin' of you, baby (Love ya, babe)
Can you roll with me (Ooh, baby)
All over me
Can you take control of me
I just want to love you, baby
Always thinkin' of you, baby

I think I like how your body feels next to me
Aw, baby, when you're kissin' me
Aw, baby, when you're lovin' me
I can't describe what I want to do to you tonight
Aw, baby, when you come to me
I'll make it so you'll never leave

[Chorus]

See, I don't know if I can handle you as just a friend
Aw, baby, I can't pretend
Aw, baby, I'm so far in
But I don't mind as long as I could have you in my
Life
Aw, baby, I'm satisfied
Even if you're not just mine

[Chorus]

Boy, you make me not the same
(Aw baby, aw baby, oh baby, oh baby)
If you feel me help me say
(Aw baby, aw baby, oh baby, oh baby)

Can you rock with me (Aw, baby)
Non-stop with me (I want to rock with you)
Can you take it to the top with me
I just want to love you, baby (Oh)
Always thinkin' of you, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]

Can you roll with me (Oh, baby)
All over me
Can you take control of me
I just want to love you, baby (I want to love you, babe)
Always thinkin' of you, baby

Love you, babe
Love you, babe
