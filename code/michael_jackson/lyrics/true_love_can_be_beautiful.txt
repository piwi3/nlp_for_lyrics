Searching
Been looking everywhere
Soon I'll find you, girl
I know I'm getting closer now
Can't wait to hold you, girl

The day I find you, girl, you'll love me

Hey, girl
When you're in my arms you'll want to keep for me
I'm sure
Cause my love's that strong you'll be too weak to leave me

The day I find you, girl, you'll love me

Each day I try harder
With faith and confidence
I know I'll get you

True love can be beautiful but it takes time
True love can be beautiful but it takes time

So close
I can still feel your heartbeat but you're not here
But my searching is all over now that you're growing near

Today I finally found you, girl, and you love me

You're here in my arms
Where you'll stay today
Always
Always

True love can be beautiful but it takes time
True love can be beautiful but it takes time

Today I found you, girl
You love me

True love can be beautiful but it takes time
True love can be beautiful but it takes time
