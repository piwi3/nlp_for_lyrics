This is just a little love song
From me to you
I just want to say I thank you
For loving me like you do
I'm so happy your the one song
Just to good to be true
Gonna dedicate this love song, this love song to you

Yesterday my empty heart had nothin' to do
But sit alone, and sanging the blues
Who ever think, I change my tunes
Well it was easy when I'm with you

I feel the rhythm of the love song
Love song
Sanging all day long
So take my hand, and we will dance the song
While the dance is on
(hey)

Yesterday my empty heart had nothin' to do
But sit alone, and sanging the blues
Who ever think, I change my tunes
Well it was easy when I'm with you

This is just a little love song
From me to you
I just want to say I thank you

For loving me like you do
Oh baby, when I feel the word I love you
Well you say it too.

I love you
I love you
Love song, love song

Oh, baby baby baby this is just a little love song.
From me to you
You just say you do
My little love song
My love song to you
Ooh ooh doo doo doo doo doo doo ooh

Love song, love song
