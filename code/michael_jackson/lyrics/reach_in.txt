Can't find no rhyme to it all
But still we keep on trying
The why and where of it all
Inside you the answer is lying

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade (?) of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in
Shine, shine, shine, shine.

Don't take the easy way out
Believe there is a Maker
Don't be a body of doubt
In whom does live a faker

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in

A soul without love
Is a soul without meaning
And the Lord up above
He'll destroy every being 

Reach in...
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

(Etc., etc., - they vamp till the end)
