Give me
Give me
Give me

Give me half a chance
Oh your life's gonna have new meaning
Yes it will
Why don't you give me half a chance?
Give me half a chance

I'll prove my love to you, it's true
Come on and give me half a chance
Oh, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will
If you would give me half a chance
Give me half a chance
There's so much I would do for you

Love put us two together
But we don't know how to stay

Give me half a chance
If you just wait and see
Give me half a chance
Your heart will be set free
Give me half a chance

For I know that you'd want me
If you'd only
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance

Girl, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will

Love put us two together
But we don't know how to stay

Give me half a chance
If you just wait and see
Give me half a chance
Your heart will be set free
Give me half a chance

For I know that you'd want me
If you'd only
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance

Give me, give me, give me
Give me half a chance
Why don't you?

Give me, give me, give me
Give me half a chance
Why don't you?

Give me, give me, give me
Give me half a chance
Why don't you give me?
Why don't you give me, baby?
