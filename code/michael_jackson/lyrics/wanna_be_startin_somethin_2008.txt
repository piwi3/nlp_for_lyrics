I met her on the walkway
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I cant help but to ask
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' something

We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a necklace shade
We hit off until the morning
Until you hear her say

Ama ma se,
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,
Ma ma coo sa [Repeat x10]

Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin',
You got to be startin' somethin'.
I said you wanna be startin' somethin',
You got to be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying
Talkin', squealin', lyin you got my baby crying

[Chorus]

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over, (YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)

Its getting lil' crazy (its getting crazy)
Always messin' with my baby(messing with my baby)
And thats the reason she cries
Cause when I am not by her side
I had the loneliest night (without my baby)
But I love how you (you)
Always pop up when I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I wanna bring back that night we shared 
And that look on your face
When you say!

[Chorus]

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA) [x2]
