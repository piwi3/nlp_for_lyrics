If you believe
Within your heart you'll know
That no one can change
The path that you must go

Believe what you feel
And know you're right because
The time will come around
When you say it's yours

Believe there's a reason to be
Believe you can make time stand still
You know from the moment you try
If you believe, I know you will

Believe in yourself right from the start
You'll have brains, you'll have a heart
You'll have courage
To last your whole life through

If you believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself
As I believe in you
