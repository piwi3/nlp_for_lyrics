This is not your ordinary record

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things
Kids are murderin' other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist they put a gun in it
want to be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy, you know it's killing me

So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encaged like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
And peace of mind is hard to find

I want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place, no substitution for restitution
The only solution for peace is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach
When all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds
We all must unite
To turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love
We're disrespecting each other
What happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world
Already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The pressure's building and I've had enough

I want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now
Shout

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place, no substitution for restitution
The only solution for peace is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions

How we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

I want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now
Shout

Shout

Shout

Shout

Shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now
