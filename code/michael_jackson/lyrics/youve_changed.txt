Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
 I remember when you was a little girl
 I say you never ever ever wore curls
You wore nothing but an old shaggy, shaggy
dress
 I say you never ever try to look your best.
 Now when I look at you
 All my love come a'running through.
You've changed and it's showing
My love for you is growing
You've changed and it's showing
Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
 You legs were little
 But now they are big
Instead of wearing a pony tail
 You wear a little red wig
 Your eyes are pretty
 You got some kissable lips
And I love the way you walk
 'cause you swing your hips!
 Now when I look at you
 All my love come a'running through
You've changed and it's showing
My love for you is growing
You've changed and it's showing.
Hoo hoo. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah.
 (Your walk) Oooh, baby, I love the way you
walk.
 (Your talk) Oooh, oooh, the way you speak to
me.
(Your look) Oooh, my heart is shook.
 (Your eyes) Oooh, baby, hypnotize.
 Now when I look at you
 All my love come a'running through
You've changed and it's showing
My love for you is growing
You've changed and it's showing.
