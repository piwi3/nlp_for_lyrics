Why don`t you believe me when I say that i love you? 
I`m crazy `bout you 
You wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain`t true 
I`m all about you 
You`re my desire 
I get higher every time I speak your name 
That`s all I do 
And the way that I can`t sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I`m crazy `bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don`t love, when it`s giving my love pains 
It`s the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it`s driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
 
Why don`t you believe me when I say that I am true 
I`m crazy `bout you 
I`m here to love and please you, I`ll do what you want me to 
I`m all about you 
Living and hoping, but I`m coping 
With these things you put me through 
That`s all I do 
The way that I can`t sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I`m crazy `bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don`t love, when it`s giving my love pains 
It`s the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it`s driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
