(Love is the thing you need)

Ooh, I know a fortune teller
A very freaky fella
How 'bout you like me to tell ya
(Love is the thing you need) Let me say now

A family physician
Gave me a prescription
For a nice disposition
(Love is the thing you need)

So, when all your frustrations
Don't receive no medication
How bad you feel
Oh, it's just unreal
Oh, you can't get no satisfaction
When your mind is overacting
And you don't give your self the love you need

(So get on up)
And get down, down, down
With some good ol' funky, funky love
(Love is the thing you need) Fellas
(Love is the thing you need) Ah, hit it,

Make you feel so good
Make your body shake like crazy
Give yourself a get and go, yeah
(Love is the thing you need) The midnight hour

(Love is the thing you need) (Love is the thing you need)
(Love is the thing you need) Sing it again
(Love is the thing you need) (Love is the thing you need)
When that somebody finds you down (Love is the thing you need)
Love comes up from underground (Love is the thing you need)

Oh, love (Oh, love)
Yeah, some people they don't know
That it's the only way to go
If you wanna live a happy, happy life yeah, yeah

Oh, there ain't no doubt about it
We just can't live without it
No we can't, no we can't
Sing it to me children

(Love is the thing you need) One more time, yeah
(Love is the thing you need) Sing it, yeah,
Once a day, twice a day, everyday
(Love is the thing you need) What you say now
Once a day, twice a day, good God, everyday

You gotta, gotta have love
