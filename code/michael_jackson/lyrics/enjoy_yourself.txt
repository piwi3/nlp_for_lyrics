Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
Better enjoy yourself

You sittin' over there
Starin' into space
While people are dancin'
Dancin' all over the place
You shouldn't worry
About things that you can't control
Come on, girl
While the night is young
Why don't you let yourself
Let yourself go
Woo!

Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time you and me
Sittin' there with your mouth poked out
Just sweet as you can be
Why don't you live
Live the life you've got
Come on, girl
Let's get it
While the music's runnin' hot
Woo!

Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

Pretty girl, I've been watching you
I can wipe away that frown
Ah, you and I
Can get together
We can tear the house down
We can tear the house down
We can tear the whole house down
Woo!

Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
You got to enjoy yourself
