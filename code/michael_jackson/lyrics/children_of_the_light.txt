Children of the Light, oh
Children of the Light, oh

People work and people talk
And think that their alive
But ask them what their life's about
Their quick to run and hide

People laugh and people cry
But never realize
That all the worlds tomorrows lays in what they feel inside

So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night

We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light

Children of the light

Walk together
All of my brothers, walk together
All of my sisters, walk forever
All of my children, children smile

The time has come for everyone
To stop and look around
To see just where we started from
And wonder where we're bound

The ship we're on has lost it's way

So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light

Everybody!

So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light

So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light

So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light
