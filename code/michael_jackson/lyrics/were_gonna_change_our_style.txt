We're gonna change our style
Bring on a brand new style
We're gonna make funky music
Swing to a brand new beat
One that is more unique
Listen to the music
Go wow, go wow

Unchain, unchain
That sweet melody
'cause it's passe
The words might rhyme
Half of the time
Ain't much to say
Remember when we used to sing

Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh
Let's turn it over, inside out

We're gonna change our style
Bring on a brand new style
We're gonna make funky music
Yeah yeah yeah

Give me that funky music, funky music yeah
Give it to me baby, play it for me baby
Give, give it to me, give it to me baby
Give it, give it to me baby
That funky music, that soulful music
Give me that funky music, groovy music
Let's do it baby, baby let's do it

We're gonna make funky music (get on down)
We're gonna make funky music

Get it, get it, get on down
Get it, get it, get on down
Get it, get it, get on down
Get it, get it, get on down
