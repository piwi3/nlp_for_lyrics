Bad news, bad news! 
I heard you're packing to leave! 
I come running right over
I just couldn't believe it
I couldn't believe it

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing

I've never done you no wrong
I never hit you when you're down
I always gave you good thing
I never ran around
I never ran around

[Chorus]

There's something you ought to know
If you're fixing to go
I can't make it without you
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no

[Chorus]

We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing
