Sun is in the sky
Shining everywhere
But I don't see the light
And no one seems to care

That's why I'm packing up again
Gotta leave this empty life
Got a ticket in my hand
So look for me tonight

Baby, I'm coming home
Coming home
Coming home
(Baby, won't you leave on the porch light)

So happy I'm coming home
Coming home
Where I belong

Baby
I ain't too proud to get on my knees
To tell you how I miss you
To tell you how I miss my baby

You can say hello
(You can say hello)
And make me feel alive
(Make me feel alive)
Ooh, heaven only knows
(Heaven only knows)
Happy tears will fill my eyes

Oh, you can turn away
And make me want to cry
Tell me it's too late
But I got to know I tried

That's why I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Ooh baby, I'm coming home
(Baby, won't you leave on the porch light)

So happy I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Where I belong
(With you, babe)
(I belong with you, babe)
(Back to you)

Baby
Life ain't been so good to me
Gon' tell you what it's like, girl
(Life without you)
I want you
Need you

So baby, I'm coming home
Coming home
Back where I belong
So baby, won't you leave on the porch light

(Coming home)
Look out your window
(Coming home)
Coming on the corner
(Coming home)
Out through your doorstep
Ooh baby, I'm coming home
Coming home
Back where I belong

(Coming home)
(Coming home)
(Coming home)
(Coming home)
(Coming home)
(Coming home)
(Coming home)
