Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul

Let's have a party (let's have a party), ooh
Let's have a party (let's have a party)
Send him  to the store
Let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room

Let's have a party (let's have a party), ooh
Let's have a party (let's have a party)
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor

Let's have a party (let's have a party), ooh
Let's have a party (let's have a party)
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

The meat is on the stove
The bread is getting hot
Tell me pretty baby

Let's have a party (let's have a party), ooh
Let's have a party (let's have a party)
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
We're going to have a party tonight!
