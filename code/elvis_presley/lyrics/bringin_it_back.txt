If I can never see you, if I can never hold you
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
I still remember talkin', I still remember laughin'
I still remember lovin' a lot, yes touchin' you, babe I've not forgot

And everything's bringin' it back, you're only just bringin' it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
Even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back

Thinkin' in my solitude, wonderin' about your attitude
Thinkin' maybe that your love has died, there it is, I can see it in your eyes
And a look of sweet surrender but a touch of too much sadness
'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows
And you just can't stay, oh but you can't let go

'Cause everything's bringin' it back, you're only just bringin' it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
And even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back

And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
And even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back
And everything's bringin' it back, bringin' it back
