Well, you come home feeling for the knob on the door
You better pick up your feet, you're gonna fall on the floor
I keep on telling you, I'll tell you some more
You better leave that junk alone and drink water

Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
You don't wanna be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top and drink cool H2O

Well, your eyes are baggy and a bloodshot red
It's been a week or two since you've been in bed
You better pay attention now to what I said
You better leave that junk alone and drink water

Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
You don't wanna be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top and drink cool H2O

Well, now I'll forgive you for your running around
If you just promise that you come unwound
I'll buy you anything you want in town
If you'll leave that junk alone and drink water

Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
You don't wanna be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top and drink cool H2O
