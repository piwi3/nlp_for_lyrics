Now, if you love me
Let's please don't  tease
If I can hold you then
Let me squeeze
My heart goes 'round and 'round
My love comes tumblin' down
You leave me breathless

Well, I shake all over and
You know why
I'm sure it's love and
That's no lie
'Cause when you call my name
You know I burn like wood inflamed
You leave me breathless

Oh, baby, mm crazy
You're much too much
Honey, I can't love you enough
It's all right to hold me tight
But when you love me
Love me right

Oh, come on, baby
Don't be shy
'Cause love was  meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow
I'm gonna be wherever you go
You have left me breathless

Well, it's all right to hold me tight
But when you love me
Love me right

Oh, come on, baby
Don't be shy
Love was  meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow
I'm going to be wherever you go
You leave me breathless
