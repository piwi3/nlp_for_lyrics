You may ask me how I know my Lord is real (my Lord is real)
You may doubt the things I say and doubt the way I feel (the way I feel)
But I know He's real today, He'll always be (He'll always be)
I can feel His hand in mine and that's enough for me

I will never walk alone, He holds my hand (He holds my hand)
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall I know He'll understand
Till the day He tells me why He loves me so (He loves me so)
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know

I can feel His hand in mine

That's all I need to know
