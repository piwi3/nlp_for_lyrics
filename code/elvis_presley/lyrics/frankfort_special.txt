Is this train the Frankfort Special?
Ain't this outfit something special?
Ah, we heard rumors from the bases
Frankfort girls got pretty faces

Go, Special, go, blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa, oh, oh

Now when we get to our headquarters
We'll be good boys and follow orders
Now don't take girls from one another
No, no, no, no, no
We'll treat a sailor like a brother

Go, Special, go; blow, whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa, oh, oh

Round wheels singin' on a long flat track
Boiler bustin' to blow its stack
Towns and villages flyin' by
Farewell, frauleins; don't you cry
You'll soon get another G.I.

Come on, train, and get the lead out
Well, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration

Go, Special go, blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go

Go, Special, go, blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa, oh, oh

Come on, train, and get the lead out
Oh, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration

Go, Special, go, blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
