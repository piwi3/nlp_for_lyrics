Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
Oh, but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill

Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Well, to listen to the rain to beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill, well, oh

Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
But to listen to the rain to beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill

Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
In our little cabin home on the hill
