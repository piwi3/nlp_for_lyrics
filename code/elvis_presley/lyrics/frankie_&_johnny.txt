Little frankie went down to the barroom 
She asked for a glass of beer she said, hey
Bartender has my johnny been here he's my man but 
He's done me wrong the bartender said
Frankie you know I won't tell you no lie 
He left here about a minute ago with a gal named 
Alice fry he's your man but he's doing you wrong 
Frankie was a good little woman surely everybody 

Knows she paid one hundred dollars for johnny's 
New suit of clothes she loved her man but 
He done her wrong then frankie went down broadway 
With a razor in her hand she said, stand back 
All you women I'm looking for my cheating man 
Yes, he's my man but he's done me wrong 
It was on a Friday morning about a half past 
Nine o'clock frankie pulled her .44 and fired 

Three fatal shots she shot her man cause 
He done her wrong why don't you run, frankie 
They said, frankie why don't you run cause here comes 
The chief of police with the .44 smokeless gun
