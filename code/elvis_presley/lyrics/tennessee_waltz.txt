I was dancin' with my darlin'
To the tennessee waltz
When an old friend
I happened to see

I introduced him to my darlin'
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole
My sweetheart from me

I remember the night
Of the tennesse waltz
Now I know just
How much I have lost

Yes, I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playin'
The beautiful tennesse waltz.
