[Chorus]
I'm just a smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills i love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above

The closer and closer i get to home
The more excited i am
Those were the mornings i'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam

[Chorus]

I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How i long to be with them following the hounds
A-huntin' again
Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear

[Chorus]

I traveled around and met lots of girls
No matter how many i see
I left some pretty ones behind
I know back home is where i'll find
The girl whose love is meant for me

[Chorus]
