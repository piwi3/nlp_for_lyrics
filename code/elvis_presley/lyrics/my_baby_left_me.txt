Yes my baby left me,
Never said a word
Was it something I done,
Something that she heard?

My baby left me,
My baby left me
My baby even left me,
Never said a word

But I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman,
Hate to say goodbye

You know she left me,
Yes, she left me
My baby even left me,
Never said a word, (play the blues boys)

Baby, one of these mornings,
Lord, it won't be long,
You'll look for me baby
And your daddy will be long gone

You know you left me,
You know you left me
My baby even left me,
Never said goodbye

Now, I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and moan
All I know is that
The one I love is gone

My baby left me,
You know she left me
My baby even left me,
Never said a word

Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
