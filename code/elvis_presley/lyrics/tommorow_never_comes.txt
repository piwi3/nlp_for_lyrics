Oh, you tell me that you love me
Yes, you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow's never there

[Chorus:]
Oh, tomorrow never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes

Many weeks now have I waited
Many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning
When I'd have you by my side

[Chorus:]

So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes, tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow you'll be weeping
But tomorrow never comes

[Chorus:]
