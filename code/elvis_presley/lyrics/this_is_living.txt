[Chorus]
This is living, full of fun and free
This is living, that's the life for me

It's good to laugh and sing, don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile, cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all, life has got to be a ball

[Chorus]

It wouldn't mean a thing 
If I could be a king 
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire 
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got

[Chorus]

Don't want to settle down
I gotta move around 
I gotta lot of time 
I'm gonna wait and find 
The kinda girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
