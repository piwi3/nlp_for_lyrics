I want to clap my hands
I want to clap my hands
I want to clap my hands
For my good fortune

I want to clap my feet
I want to clap my feet
I want to clap my feet
For my good fortune

Each time I hold you
I'm really in a spin
You can see without your love
Just where I might've been

I'm gonna give a shout
Stand right up and shout
I'm gonna give a shout
Clap my feet, clap my hands
For my good fortune

Each time I hold you
I'm really in a spin
You can see without your love
Just where I might've been

I'm gonna give a shout
Stand right up and shout
I'm gonna give a shout
I'm gonna clap my feet
I'm gonna clap my hands
For my good fortune

Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
