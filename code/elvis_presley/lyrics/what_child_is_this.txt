(Children, children) what child is this, who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

(Mary) So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own him
The King of Kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

Raise, raise a song on high
The mother sings a lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the son of Mary
