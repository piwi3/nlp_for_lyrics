I remember my first love affair (I remember)
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong (I remember)
My mama had some great advice (I remember)
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song (I remember)
I can still hear her sayin' it (I remember)

Boy, oh, I see you're sittin' out there all alone (boy, oh)
Cryin' your eyes out 'cause the woman that you love has gone
Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life (whole lotta trouble)
Oh, so listen to me, get up off your knees
'Cause only the strong survive
That's what she said, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go all around with your head hung down
Well, I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know that she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lotta girls (whole lotta girls)
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet 'em if you give up now
And say your life is through
And she said, only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand

(Boy)
(Boy)
(Oh,boy)
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Well, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Well, you've got to be a man (yeah), you've got to take a stand (yeah)
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
