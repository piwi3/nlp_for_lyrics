Ho jump down, spin around, let's have a party
Look who's back, stay away Joe
Chock taw, chick a shaw, gonna drink me hearty
Welcome back, stay away Joe

Stay away Joe they call me
Stay away Joe oh yeah!
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there

Take one guess, stay away Joe
Always findin' trouble a-plenty

Giddy up look at him look at him go

Stay away Joe oh yeah!
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho!
