I don't need a lot of presents
To make my christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh oh Santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

The christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Oh oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like christmas
Until my baby's here
Fill my sock with candy
And a bright and shiny toy
You want to make me happy and fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

Please make these reindeer hurry

Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
