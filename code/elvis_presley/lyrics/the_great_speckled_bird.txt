What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded
On the pages of God's holy word

Desiring to lower her standards
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching
But really she makes no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look

And when He come descending from Heaven
On a cloud like He said in His word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of the great speckled bird
