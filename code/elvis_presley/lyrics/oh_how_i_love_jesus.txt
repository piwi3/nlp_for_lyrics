Ohh oh oh oh
When I am disgraced
And I feel the gloom
God sends His angel

To see Him my broom
Joy bells are ringing
I'm satisfied
I know, I know that Jesus is mine

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
To know that Jesus is mine

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
To know that Jesus is mine
