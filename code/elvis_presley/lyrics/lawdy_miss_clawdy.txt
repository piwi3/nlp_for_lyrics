Well, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, Miss Clawdy
Well, you sure look good to me
Well, please, don't excite me, baby
I know it can't be me

Well, I give you all my money
Yeah, but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

I'm gonna tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear, gal, what you been doing to me?
I'm gonna tell everybody that
I'm in misery

So bye, bye, bye, baby
Gal, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye, little darlin'
Down the road I go

Oh, goodbye, bye, bye, baby
Gal, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye, little darlin'
Down the road I go
