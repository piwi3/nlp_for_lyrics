You came when I was happy; in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay
If you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it
If you love me, let it be. If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello, it's good to see you
Anytime I turn around to find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see?
You now you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be
 
If you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it
If you love me, let it be. If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you
Ah! Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you
