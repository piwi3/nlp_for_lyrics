Do you remember
The love we had for each other?
I was your faithy

I miss you so
Please, believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know

Please, understand just how I feel
Your love for me might not reveal
And if you know this time it's real
I will understand

I miss you so
Please, believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know

Please, understand just how I feel
Come back to me; my love is real
And you will know this timeless feeling
I will understand
I will understand
