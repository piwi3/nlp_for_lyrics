Oh, it won't seem like Christmas, dear, without you
For too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams

Seems a long time since we've been together
It was just about this time of the year
Looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here

But it won't seem like Christmas, oh, without you
For too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams

In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our Christmas last year

Oh, it won't seem like Christmas, oh, without you
For too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams
