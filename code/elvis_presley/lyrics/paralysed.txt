When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotised
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed

When we kissed, ooh, what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
All I could do was stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ever since the day you came my way, ooh-ooh-ooh
You made my life for me, just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning, At night I'm still the same

Oh well, Do you remember that wonderful time
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of a preacher you said I do
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
