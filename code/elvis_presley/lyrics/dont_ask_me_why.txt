I'll go on loving you (loving you)
Don't ask me why (don't ask me why)
Don't know what else to do 
Don't ask me why

How sad my heart would be (heart would be)
If you should go (if you should go)
Though you're not good for me 
I want you so

It's not the kind
Of love I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without

You're all I'm longing for (longing for)
Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I need you more and more 
Don't ask me why
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why (don't ask me why)
