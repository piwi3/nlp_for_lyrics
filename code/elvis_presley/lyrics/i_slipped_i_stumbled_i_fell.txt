I look at you and wham, I'm head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell

One crazy kiss and bam, I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell

I never thought I'd get tricked 
By you sweet talking lies
You've got a bag of tricks
And when you get busy
I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks

My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
