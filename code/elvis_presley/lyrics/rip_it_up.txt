'Cause it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go
Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
And I'm feelin' fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna ride it out
And ball tonight

I got a date and I won't be late
Pick her up in my '88'
Shag it on down to the union hall
When the music starts jumpin'
I'll have a ball

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna ride it out
And ball tonight

Along about 10 I'll be flying high
Rocking on out into the sky
I don't care if I spend my gold
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna ride it out
And ball tonight, aw

Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go
Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
And I'm feelin' fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna ride it out
And ball tonight

Along about 10 I'll be flying high
Rocking on out into the sky
I don't care if I spend my gold
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna ride it out
And ball tonight
