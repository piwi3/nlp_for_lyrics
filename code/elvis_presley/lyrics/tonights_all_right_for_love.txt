Hold me tight the moon's so bright
Tonight the night is right for love
As warmed by one as stars are bright
I hold you oh so close my dear
Things could be that magic kiss
That night of this we've waited for
Oh we could fly right up to the sky
How real it all seems to me
That summer night dream to me
Can't you see that tonight's all right for love
Oh we could fly right up to the sky
How real it all seems to me
That summer night dream to me
Can't you see that tonight's all right for love
