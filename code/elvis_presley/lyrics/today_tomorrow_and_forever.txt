I give,
Give you my heart,
Today tomorrow and forever,
You'll always be my love,
I vow we'll never part,
Today tomorrow and forever,
Long as there's stars above.

The cares of life will fade away,
As long as we're together.

So stay,
Stay in my arms
Today tomorrow and forever,
You'll always be my love.

I give,
Give you my heart,
Today tomorrow and forever,
You'll always be my love.

The cares of life will fade away,
As long as we're together.

So stay,
Stay in my arms
Today tomorrow and forever,
You'll always be my love,
(Today tomorrow and forever,)
You'll always be my love.
