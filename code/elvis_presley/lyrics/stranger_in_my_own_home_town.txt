I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town

My so-called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down
No, can't get him down

I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago
I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago, oh

My home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more

Tell me why, man!

My home town won't accept me
I just don't feel welcome here no more

I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
Yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so-called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down

Boyo, play it down now

I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago
My so-called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down

Play it again, play it again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so-called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down
