The girl I never loved will never
Know I care,and all my dreams of her
Are dreams I'll never share.

Oh I  want her and I need her
And I know  it  might have been,
But it ended long before it could
Begin.

The kiss I never got,somebody else
Will take.

The plans I never made,somebody else
Will make.

Oh I'm lonely,I'm so lonely cause
It's her I'm thinking of,
But she will always be the girl I
Never loved.

Never loved... never loved.
