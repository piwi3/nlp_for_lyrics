I saved a lot of money, my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized, my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you

My treasure unmeasured
But forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured
But it don't hold a heart of the one that I love
