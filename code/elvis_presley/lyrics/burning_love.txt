When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on

And you're always there
To lend a hand in everything I do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
(Wonder of you)

And when you smile, the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything

I guess I'll never know
The reason why you love me like you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you

I guess I'll never know
The reason why you love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
