I see the the sunlight in her hair 
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love 
But I just can't get enough 

From the distance of my mind 
The Clock that's ringing says it's time 
To wake up to my destiny 
It's time to face reality 

It's only love 
That I feel inside 
But I'll get by somehow 
It's only love 
There must be something else for me girl 

I tell myself that it's not real 
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way 
Tomorrow brings another day 

It's Only love that I feel inside 
I've got to be strong 
But my mind's hangin' on
It's only love 
But I know I'll get by 
Take my heart and my pride 
And just throw it aside

It's only love
It's only love 
It's only love
It's only love
