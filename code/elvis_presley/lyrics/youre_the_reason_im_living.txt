You're the reason I'm livin'
You're the breath that I take
You're the stars in my heaven
You're the sun when I wake

You're the reason I'm livin'
Oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you

A long, long time ago
When I was down
Oh, you picked me up and showed me
True love still could be found

You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you

Come and tell me again.....

You're The Reason I'm Livin'
Oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you.
