I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days, may your days
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
