If you found someone new who means more than me to you.
I'd never stand in your way
If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart
I'll never stand in your way

I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and i'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but i'll never let it show.
I'd never stand in your way
