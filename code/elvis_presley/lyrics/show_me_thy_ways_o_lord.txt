Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Help me love when I'm hated
Spread joy unabated
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Jesus was more than just a man from Galilee
Christ the son of God, he died for you and me
They scorched him and walked him upon in delight (?)
Still Jesus loved them, forgave and he cried
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Help me love when I'm hated
Spread joy unabated
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
Help me love when I'm hated
Spread joy unabated
Show me Thy ways, O Lord
