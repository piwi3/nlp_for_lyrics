Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel 
That old storm brewing in this heart of mine 
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new 
But now I'm so lonely all the time 

Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new 
While your heart keeps sayin' your not mine not mine 
Not mine not mine my troubled minds grows blue 
To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time 

Now take all those precious dreams I had for you dear 
And take all that love I thought was mine 
Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new 
But now I 'm so lonely all the time 

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new 
While my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine 
Not mine not mine not mine my troubled mind goes blue 
To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time
