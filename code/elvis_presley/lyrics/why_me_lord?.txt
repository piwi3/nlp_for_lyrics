(Why Me Lord? What have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving you
And the kindness you've shown)

Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him
So help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands

(Try me Lord, if you think there's a way I can ever repay
All I've taken from you
Forgive Lord I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you)

Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him
So help me Jesus I know what I am, Oh yes!
Now that I know that I needed you so
Help me Jesus my soul's in your hands
Jesus my soul's in your hands
