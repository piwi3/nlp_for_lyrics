Lordy only believe, only believe
All things are possible

My Lordy, only believe, yes only believe
All things are possible
If you'll only believe

I met God one morning my soul feeling bad
Heart heavy laden I felt fire doubt ahead 
Well He lifted all my burdens, yeah! right now I'm feeling glad
All things are possible
If you'll only believe

I believe, yeah! I believe,
All things are possible
If you'll only believe
