You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss you're lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your finger tips
You've trying hard not to show it
Baby, baby I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Woohoo that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone woohoo
Yeah

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes just feel like crying
Baby 'cause baby something beautiful is dying

You've lost that loving feeling
Woohoo that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone wohohohoho

Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
This suit wasn't too tight
If you would only would love me like you used to do
Yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Listen to me, talking to me

Bring back that loving feeling
Woho That loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go one wohohohoho
Wohohohohoho wohohohoho
