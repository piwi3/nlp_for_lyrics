I'll be a strong as a mountain
Or weak as a willow tree
Any way you want me
Well, that's how I will be

I'll be a tame as a baby
Or wild as the raging sea
Any way you want me
Well, that's how I will be

In your hands my heart is clay
To take and hold as you may
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me
And in your arms I will stay-ay-ay

I'll be a fool or a wise man
My darling, you hold the key
Yes, any way you want me
That's how I will be
I will be
