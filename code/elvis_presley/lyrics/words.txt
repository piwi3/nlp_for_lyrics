Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost his glory
Let's start a brand new story
now , my love
Right now , there'll be no other time
And I can show you how
My love

Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words 
And words are all I have 
To take your heart away

Na 
na na na na na na
na na na na na na na na
na na 
na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na 
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words          
And words are all I have 
To take your heart away  
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
