Earth angel, earth angel
Will you be mine
My darling dear?
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you

Earth angel, earth angel 
The one I adore
Love you forever and ever more
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you

I fell for you 
And I knew
The vision of your lov-loveliness
I hoped and I prayed that someday
That I'd be the vision of your hap-happiness

Oh, oh
Earth angel, earth angel
Please, be mine
My darling dear 
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool 
A fool in love with you
