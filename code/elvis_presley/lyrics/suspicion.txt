Every time you kiss me, I'm still not certain that you love me 
Every time you hold me, I'm still not certain that you care 
Though you keep on saying you really, really, really love me 
Do you speak the same words to someone else when I'm not there? 

Suspicion torments my heart 
Suspicion keeps us apart 
Suspicion--why torture me? 

Every time you call me and tell me we should meet tomorrow 
I can't help but think that you're meeting someone else tonight 
Why should our romance just keep on causing me such sorrow 
Why am I so doubtful whenever you are out of sight? 

Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion--why torture me?

Darling, if you love me, I beg you wait a little longer 
Wait until I drive all these foolish fears out of my mind 
How I hope and pray that our love will keep on growing stronger 
Maybe I'm suspicious 'cause true love is so hard to find 

Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion--why torture me?
