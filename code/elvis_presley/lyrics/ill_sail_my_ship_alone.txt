We've been sweethearts for so long
But now you say we're through
The love you said
Is just a memory

I have built a ship of dreams
I planned then all for you
I guess what will be
My dear, will be

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across
The ocean blue

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
And when it starts to sinking
I'll blame you

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you will hear my s.o.s

Maybe you would come back home
My darling, if you knew
How much my aching heart
Is in distress

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across
The ocean blue

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
And when it starts to sinking
I'll blame you
