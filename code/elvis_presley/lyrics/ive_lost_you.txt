Lying by your side, I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind

Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold?
Softly happening the joy is over
Though why it's gone neither of us know

Oh, I've lost you, yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore 
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling

Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleepy, to the door
In the chill and sun gray of the morning
We play the parts that we have learned to well
