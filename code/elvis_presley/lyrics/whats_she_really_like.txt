What's she really like
The girl that you see me with? 
What's she really like
The one I'm so dreamy with? 
Well, let me tell you she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine

Told her that her lips, her lips are so thrillable
I can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
She's even more than adorable
And what's moreable she's all mine

You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh

What's she really like
The girl I go on about? 
What's she really like
The one I'm so gone about? 

All I can say she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine

You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh

What's she really like
The girl I go on about? 
What's she really like
The one I'm so gone about? 

All I can say: she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Adorable and she's mine
Marvelous and she's mine
Wonderful and she's mine
