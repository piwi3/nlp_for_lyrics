When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back in my arms to stay

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But someday they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again sweetheart
But my blue moon is just a memory

The castles we used to build together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
