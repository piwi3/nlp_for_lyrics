There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home

Well I used to have a sweetheart
To walk and talk with me
But now I have no sweetheart
What pleasure do I see

There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home
