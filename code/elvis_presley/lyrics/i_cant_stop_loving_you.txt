And I can't stop loving you
I said, "I made up, made up my mind"
To live in memory
Of such an long lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
I said, "It's useless to say"
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Now those happy hours
All that we once knew
They're so long ago (so long ago)
They still make, make me blue

Ah they say, "that time
It heals a broken heart"; oh yes, it does
Ah, but time has stood still
Since we've been apart

And I can't stop loving you
I said, "I made up, made up my mind"
To live in memory
Of such an long lonesome time

And I can't stop wanting you
I said, "It's useless to say"
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday, oh yeah
