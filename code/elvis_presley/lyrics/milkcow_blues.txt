Well, I've tried everything
Just to get along with you
And now I'm gonna tell you
Just what I'm gonna do

Well, I'm sick of all your cryin'
When you should be leavin' me alone
If you don't believe me
You pack my bags, I'm gone

Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
You almost lost your love, girl
When your old man ain't around

Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
And you best believe I love you, baby
When your old man ain't around

Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
You almost lost your love, girl
When your old man ain't around

'Round and 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round
'Round
'Round
