Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Good
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go, go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Good

His mama told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you name will be in lights saying "Johnny B. Good tonight"

[Chorus]
