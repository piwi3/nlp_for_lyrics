Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me.
Patient and loving he's waiting and watching;
Watching for you and for me.

[Chorus:]
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling;
Calling, "O sinner, come home!"

[Repeat Chorus]

Why should we linger when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we wait, then, and heed not His mercies;
Mercies for you and for me?

[Repeat Chorus]

O for the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me.
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon;
Pardon for you and for me.

[Repeat Chorus]
