Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleepin'
Worried about the way things might have been

A big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river

If you come down to the river
Betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

I said, a big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river

If you come down to the river
I betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

I said, a big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
