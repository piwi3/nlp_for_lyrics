Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas to end the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings, ooh, once again

Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, yeah, Christmas my dear 
The time of year to be with the one you love 

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam 
Christmas and New Years will find you home
Please come home for Christmas 
Please come home for Christmas 
If not for Christmas by New Year's night 

There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again
