Don't talk to strangers on the bus
You know that could be dangerous
Don't walk on stick or stones
Don't answer ringing phones
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Don't take up with no alley cats
They really don't know where it's at
Don't fall or trip on things
Stay away from happenings
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Be careful walking down the street
You never know what you might meet
Don't change a thing or two
I'm hung up child on you
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Get your groovy self on home
