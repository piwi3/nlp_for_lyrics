How do you think I feel?
I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?

How do you think we stand?
I know you've made your plan
But you've included free
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?

I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
