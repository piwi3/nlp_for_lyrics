Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll get along
I guess I will, some way
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then He put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

You asked me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll find another
I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then He put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
