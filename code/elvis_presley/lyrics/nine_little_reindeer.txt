Yes, Rudolf did make history
This was the story of an underdog who came through with flying colors
And brought happiness to children and grownups alike all over the world
Well, here's a song especially for you kids
Maybe you'd like to pull up a chair and help me sing it
Whaddaya say?

A long long time ago
As all you folks should know
Ol' Santa started loading up his sleigh
A smile on every face
Each reindeer took his place
To bring the children joy on Christmas Day
With one little, two little, three little reindeer
(Four little, five little, six little reindeer)
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

(There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen)
But there's one little reindeer missing, Rudolf is his name

For a long, long time
He had hitched up nine
To make his Christmas ride
Now Rudolph's gone
He's so alone
Santa Claus sat down and cried

With one little, two little, three little reindeer
(Four little, five little, six little reindeer)
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

(Hey Santa, look, look who's coming)
(It'm Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer)
It's been a year
Since we've been here
And how the time it goes
Where have you been
My little friend?
"Shining up my nose"

There's one little, two little, three little reindeer
(Four little, five little, six little reindeer)
Seven little, eight, yes, nine little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

Peace on earth, goodwill to all
And a very merry Christmas day
