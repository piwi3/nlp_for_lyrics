Woman, when you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things I gotta know 'bout the woman I love
And after all is said and done
Girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone
So when you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?

Will he believe all those lies?
End up like me, with tears in his eyes?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things I gotta know 'bout the woman I love so
After all is said and done
Hey, girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone
So when you get through playin' with me
Who will the next fool be?

Will he believe all those lies?
End up like me, with tears in his eyes?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things I gotta know 'bout the woman I love so
You know, after all is said and done
Girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone
When you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?
