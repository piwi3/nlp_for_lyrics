I got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby 
Since a long time ago
And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
'Cause it's gonna be hard to do

I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about lovin' you

Ain't no two-ways about it baby
Your love was meant for me
Know that I can't do without it fits me to a t
Oh there's something about you baby
Can't get you off my mind
I know that I can't live without you
I think about you all the time

I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about lovin' you

Ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you 'bout
In the palm of her hand
And then she starts to thinkin'
Then maybe she's put you in a bind
She'll give you just a little lovin'
It'll drive you out of your mind

I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing you can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about lovin' you

I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about lovin' you
