Baby, let me be
Your lovin' teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Your teddy bear

I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind
You love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Your teddy bear

Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
