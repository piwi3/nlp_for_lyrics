Little darlin', little darlin'
Oh where, are you
Walla walla chipa mocka mogga
Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you

My darlin', I need you
Darlin' I need you to call my own
To hold on my life, your little foot, your hand
Knew someone would understand that, hold my hand

My dear, I would run to find without you
Oh, That my love was just for you, 'n only you
